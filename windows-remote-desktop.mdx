## Connect to Your Windows VPS

<Info>
  Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) delivers full graphical control of your Windows VPS. Bring the server’s IPv4 address, the <code>Administrator</code> password you set in the portal, and a stable network connection.
</Info>

Need to deploy Windows first? Reinstall from the EDBB portal with the <a href="/vps-management/autoinstall-reinstall-install-vps-linux-windows">OS reinstall guide</a>.

## Why Use RDP

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="🖥️ Full Desktop">
    Interact with the VPS as if you were sitting in front of the console—perfect for GUI apps, MMC tools, and quick configuration checks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🔐 Secure Transport">
    RDP sessions are encrypted end-to-end. Combine it with the portal’s one-time console access for password resets or emergency recovery.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🪟 Cross-Platform Clients">
    Microsoft ships native clients for Windows and macOS, and open-source alternatives exist for Linux—use whichever device you prefer.

## Connect from Windows Desktop

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Remote Desktop Connection">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter the VPS address">
    In the <strong>Computer</strong> field, paste the IPv4 address (or hostname) from your welcome email. Click <strong>Show Options</strong> to expand the dialogue before you connect.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect and authenticate">
    Click <strong>Connect</strong>, enter the VPS password, and accept the certificate warning. Tick “Don’t ask me again” once you trust the fingerprint so the prompt stays hidden next time.

## macOS Client (Microsoft Windows App)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Microsoft Windows App">
    Download the free client (formerly Microsoft Remote Desktop) from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mac App Store</a>.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your VPS">
    Open the app, click the <strong>+</strong> button, choose <strong>Add PC</strong>, and enter the VPS IPv4 address. Give it a friendly name so you recognise it later.

    macOS will ask about certificates and optionally keychain storage—press <strong>Continue</strong>. Enter the password and you’ll land on the Windows desktop.

## Keep RDP Secure

- Rotate the Administrator password regularly and store it in a password manager.  
- Use the portal VNC console to disable/enable RDP if you ever need to lock access quickly.  
- Maintain Windows Updates (`Settings → Windows Update`) so security patches install promptly.

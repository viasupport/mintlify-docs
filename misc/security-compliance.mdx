  workloads stand.

## Operational Security Layers

- **Continuous monitoring** – Real-time metrics, IDS/IPS feeds, and anomaly alerts watched by our on-call engineers.  
- **Patch cadence** – Critical fixes deploy within vendor SLAs; monthly maintenance windows capture the remainder.  
- **Change control** – Peer-reviewed changes, automatic rollbacks, and release notes published to the status page.  
- **24/7 incident response** – A documented runbook plus cross-functional escalation paths keep response times low.

### Safeguarding the Organisation

1. **Security awareness** – Mandatory onboarding and refresher courses covering phishing, data handling, and privacy.  
2. **Scoped access** – Fine-grained IAM with short-lived credentials; production access is logged and reviewed.  
3. **Tabletop exercises** – Quarterly simulations validate our incident response, ransomware playbooks, and disaster recovery.  
4. **Vendor diligence** – Third parties undergo risk reviews, contractual safeguards, and periodic reassessment.  
5. **Internal & external audits** – Compliance checkpoints every six months, supplemented by penetration testing.

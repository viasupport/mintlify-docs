## Reach the EDBB Abuse Team

<Info>
  Suspected misuse of EDBB infrastructure should be reported directly to
  <strong>abuse@edbb.com</strong>. Include a clear subject line such as
  “Abuse report – IP 203.0.113.10” so our queue can triage the case quickly.
</Info>

- ✉️ Send reports in **English** so the team can process them without delay.  
- ✅ Use a mailbox that accepts replies; we may need clarification or extra logs.  
- ⏱️ Verified complaints are reviewed promptly and escalated internally if emergency action is required.

## Build a Complete Abuse Report

Organise the facts so our investigators can reproduce the issue. Each entry below is required unless noted otherwise.

### Contact & context

- Your **full name**, organisation (if applicable), phone number, and email address.  
- The **law, policy, or acceptable-use clause** you believe is being violated.  
- A brief description of the impact (e.g., phishing, DDoS, copyright infringement).

### Evidence & scope

- The **EDBB IP address** or hostname involved. Limit reports to **one IP per email**—send separate reports for multiple systems.  
- A precise **timestamp with timezone** (UTC preferred). If activity spans multiple moments, list each with matching IP data.  
- Static **URLs or download locations** for hosted content so we can inspect the material directly.  
- For spam complaints, attach the **original message with full headers** (RFC 822 format).

### Supporting material

- **Screenshots, packet captures, or log excerpts** that demonstrate the behaviour.  
- For **copyright notices**, describe the original work and provide a copy or
  public link to it.  
- For **trademark complaints**, reference the registration number and jurisdiction.  
- If your report comes from a third party (e.g., a client or law-enforcement contact), note the **authority under which you are acting**.

<Callout type="warning">
  Reports missing timestamps, source IPs, or actionable evidence cannot be processed.
  Double-check the details before you hit send.

## What Happens Next

- You’ll receive an acknowledgement once your email is in the queue.  
- The abuse desk validates the evidence, notifies the affected customer, and coordinates mitigation or service suspension where appropriate.  
- Follow-up questions arrive from the same **abuse@edbb.com** mailbox—respond promptly so the case does not stall.

## How to Correctly Report Abuse

The EDBB abuse desk handles notifications, coordinates mitigation, and communicates with authorities when necessary. Accurate reports help us respond quickly.

### Where to submit abuse reports

If you notice EDBB services being used in violation of our policies or applicable law, email **abuse@edbb.com**. Every substantiated report is reviewed promptly.

### How to create an abuse report

Please include the following information in your report.

- Submit your notification in English.
- Send it to **abuse@edbb.com**
- Do not send notifications from an address that can not be replied to (no-reply@)
- Include your name, address, telephone number and email address.
- All notifications must include the IP address where the reported content is located, or from where the conduct occurred, plus a timestamp including timezone (preferably UTC). The IP address must belong to EDBB. (For spam reports, include full headers or attach the original message.)
- The notification should reference a static URL hosted on EDBB infrastructure where the content can be inspected.
- Include one IP address per notification. If you would like to submit a notification for more than one IP address, please send multiple notifications.
- Please describe the content or behavior that you wish to report and explain why it is inappropriate, how it is infringing your rights, violating applicable law, netiquette or the terms of service.
- For trademark infringement notifications: Please include the registration details (including registration number) of the infringed trademark.
- If you believe your copyright has been infringed, please include a description of your work along with either a copy of the work or a web page address where the original content can be located.

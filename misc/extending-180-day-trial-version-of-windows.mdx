## What to Expect

<Info>
  Windows Server evaluation images include up to five <strong>rearmer</strong>
  credits. Each rearm grants another 180 days, so you can test for roughly
  36 months in total before you must license the product.
</Info>

- ⏱️ You can run the rearm at any point before the trial expires.  
- 🔁 Every rearm reduces the remaining counter—track it so you’re not surprised.  
- 🧾 Once the counter hits zero, you must activate Windows with a full license.

## Extend the Trial in Three Commands

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the current activation window">
    Launch <strong>PowerShell as Administrator</strong> and inspect the licensing
    state:<br/>
    <code>slmgr -dlv</code><br/>
    The dialog shows the remaining days and how many rearms you still have.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rearm the evaluation build">
    Trigger a fresh 180-day period with:<br/>
    <code>slmgr -rearm</code><br/>
    You will receive a confirmation pop-up when the command succeeds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reboot to apply the new timer">
    Apply the change immediately:<br/>
    <code>Restart-Computer</code><br/>
    After reboot, run <code>slmgr -dlv</code> again to verify the new expiration date.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Stay Within Microsoft’s Rules

<Callout type="warning">
  <strong>Evaluation only.</strong> Rearms are provided for lab and proof-of-concept
  use. Once testing is finished—or the rearm counter is exhausted—you must buy
  the appropriate Windows Server licence to stay compliant with Microsoft’s
  Software License Terms.
</Callout>

- ✅ Rearms are capped (typically five). Plan for the day you need to activate.  
- ✅ Document each rearm so teammates know how many are left.  
- ✅ Running in production with an evaluation build violates Microsoft policy.

When you’re ready to go live, activate Windows through your volume licence,
Azure Hybrid Benefit, or retail key so updates and support continue uninterrupted.

## How to extend your Windows trial

Windows Server evaluation editions run for **180 days**. If you’re nearing the end of the trial, you can extend it with a simple command.

> **Good to know:** Microsoft allows a **limited number of extensions (“rearms”)** on evaluation editions. The command below works only while rearms remain available — on most editions, you can rearm up to five times (for a total of about **six 180-day periods, or nearly three years** of evaluation).

### 1) Check your current license status

Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:

```powershell
slmgr -dlv
```

### 2) Extend the trial (add 180 days)

When you are close to expiry (or any time you like), run:

```powershell
slmgr -rearm
```

### 3) Restart the server

Reboot to apply the change:

```powershell
Restart-Computer
```

After the restart, your trial period is extended by another 180 days.

### Is it legal to extend a trial version of Windows?

Using the **slmgr -rearm** command to extend the trial period of Windows Server is a feature provided by Microsoft for specific editions of its software, primarily for evaluation purposes. This command resets the activation timer and can be used a limited number of times to extend the trial period, typically to allow users more time to evaluate the product before purchasing a license.

However, the legality and ethical use of this feature depend on the terms set forth in the Microsoft Software License Agreement (SLA) you agreed to when you first installed or used the software. The SLA for Windows Server editions that offer this feature generally allows for a limited number of resets of the trial period, specifically to support testing and evaluation scenarios.

While it is technically possible to use **slmgr -rearm** to extend the trial, it is essential to:

1. **Use it within the limits** specified by Microsoft, which is typically up to two times, extending the trial to a maximum of an additional 180 days.
2. **Understand it is intended for evaluation purposes** and not as a way to permanently avoid purchasing the necessary licenses for long-term use.

If you are using the software in a commercial environment or for any purpose other than evaluation, it is recommended to purchase a valid license to stay compliant with Microsoft's licensing terms and avoid any legal issues.

Always refer to the specific SLA for your version of Windows Server and consider consulting with a legal professional or Microsoft's licensing experts for advice tailored to your situation.

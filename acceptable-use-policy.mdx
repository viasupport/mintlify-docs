## 🔒 Activities and Content That Are Not Allowed

Our **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)** defines how EDBB resources may be consumed.  
Using the platform means you agree to operate legally and responsibly. Breaches may result in suspension, termination, or referral to law enforcement.

### 🚫 Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)

Hosting, transmitting, or linking to CSAM triggers an immediate shutdown of your services and will be reported to the appropriate authorities.

### 📩 Unsolicited Messaging (Spam)

Bulk unsolicited email is forbidden. Verified spam complaints lead to suspension, and repeated abuse results in cancellation without refund.

### 🌐 Network Tampering

Any attempt to interfere with EDBB or upstream network infrastructure results in instant termination.

### 🐛 Malware or Phishing

Running malware, phishing kit distribution points, or similar malicious resources is strictly prohibited and will be removed without notice.

### 💥 DDoS and Network Attacks

Launching, controlling, or facilitating DDoS tools or related reconnaissance (including unauthorized port scans) is not tolerated.

- **TOR Entry Nodes:** allowed  
- **TOR Middle Nodes and Bridges:** allowed

### 💻 Malicious Software Infrastructure

Command-and-control servers, botnet storage, dropzones, or similar tooling prompt immediate termination and notification of relevant authorities.

### ⛏️ Cryptocurrency Mining

Mining workloads of any type are disallowed on EDBB VPS plans.

### 🏷️ Counterfeit Commerce

Websites offering counterfeit or trademark-infringing goods (e.g., branded apparel replicas) are blocked and the associated services closed.

### ⚖️ Otherwise Illegal Content

If your VPS carries content that violates the law, it will be removed and the service disabled.

### 🔢 IPv6 Usage Limits

- Maximum of **20 IPv6 addresses** per VPS
- Randomized or rapidly rotating IPv6 sessions that burden routing tables are considered flooding
- Flooding the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery cache results in termination without reimbursement

# Using EDBB Services Responsibly

<Info>
  Every VPS order includes agreement to this Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Breaches can lead to immediate suspension, data deletion, and—where required by law—reports to law-enforcement authorities.
</Info>

We split the rules into three quick-reference sections so you can confirm compliance at a glance.

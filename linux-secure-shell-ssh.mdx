## Understanding Secure Shell (SSH)

Secure Shell, commonly abbreviated as **SSH**, provides encrypted remote access over untrusted networks.  
When you connect to your VPS through SSH, both commands and responses are wrapped in cryptography, protecting credentials and data from interception.

Using SSH is the recommended way to administer Linux servers because:

- Authentication and traffic are encrypted end to end
- Key pairs can enforce multi-factor-style security
- Command-line automation becomes straightforward and secure

## Connect to Your VPS with SSH

Follow these steps on your local machine:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the `ssh` command with your VPS username (typically `root`) and public IPv4 address:

```shell
ssh root@<your-vps-ip>
```

3. On the first connection, confirm the remote host fingerprint by typing `yes`.
4. Enter the password from your welcome email (or the password you set during reinstall).

If the authentication succeeds, the remote shell appears and you can manage the server securely.  
To end the session, type:

```shell
exit
```

Ensure SSH access is enabled on the VPS and that you’re using the correct credentials or keys.

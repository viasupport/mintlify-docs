## Why SSH Matters

<Info>
  SSH gives you an encrypted command-line tunnel into your VPS. Bring the server’s IPv4 address, your username (usually <code>root</code>), and the password you set during provisioning or reinstall.

    Commands, output, and credentials travel inside a secure tunnel so they cannot be intercepted on the network.

    Combine passwords with SSH keys to add an extra factor without complicating your workflow.

## Connect to Your VPS

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a terminal on your local machine">
    macOS, Linux, and Windows (PowerShell) all ship with an SSH client by default.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the SSH command">
    ```bash
    ssh root@<your-vps-ip>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trust the fingerprint once">
    On the first login, type <code>yes</code> to store the host key so future sessions can verify the server’s identity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your password or unlock your key">
    Provide the welcome-password (or the credential you set in the Control Panel during reinstallation). A successful authentication drops you into the remote shell.
  </Step>
</Steps>

To close the session at any time, type `exit` or press **Ctrl + D**.

## Quick Safety Checks

- Disable password logins and rely on SSH keys once you are comfortable.  
- Keep the package updated (`apt update && apt upgrade -y` or `dnf update -y`).  
- Limit root access by creating a sudo-capable user for daily administration.

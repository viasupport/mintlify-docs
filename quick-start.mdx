## 🚀 Quickstart Guide

Welcome to EDBB VPS Hosting! This guide helps you access, secure, and start using your new VPS in just a few minutes. Each step walks you from your welcome email to your first login and essential setup tasks.

---

## 1. **Check Your Inbox**

After ordering a VPS and after rerceiving a payment confirmation, you’ll receive a **Welcome Email** from EDBB containing:

- Your VPS Primary **IPv4 address**
- ****Username andpassword****
- **Operating system** and configuration details
- A direct link to the **management dashboard**

Don’t see the message? Inspect your **Spam** or **Junk** folders. Need help? Click the blue chat icon at the bottom of this page.

## 2. Access the Control Panel

The \*\*Control Panel \*\*keeps all VPS controls in one place:

<CtaButton label="Open EDBB Control Panel" link="https://my.edbb.com" />

Inside the panel you can:

- Start, stop, or reboot your VPS
- Reinstall your operating system
- View IP addresses and network settings
- Access the integrated VNC Console
- Monitor traffic and manage your Traffic Pool
- Order additional resources (IP addresses, RAM, vCPU cores)

> 💡 **Tip:** Use a strong password and log out after each session — especially on shared computers.

## 3. Connect to Your VPS

Once your VPS is active, connect directly using **SSH** (Linux/macOS) or **RDP** (Windows).

### For Linux VPS
Use your terminal:

```bash
ssh root@<your-vps-ip>
```

Accept the fingerprint and enter your root password from the welcome email.

### For Windows VPS
Open **Remote Desktop Connection** (mstsc) and connect to your VPS IP:

```
Computer: <your-vps-ip>
User: Administrator
```

Enter your password when prompted to access your Windows desktop.


## 4. Change Your Password

For security reasons, you should **change your default password** as soon as you log in for the first time.

### For Linux VPS

Run the following command in your SSH session:

```bash
passwd
```

Then enter:

1. Your **current password**
2. A **new strong password**
3. Confirm the new password

💡 *Tip:* Use at least 12 characters, including upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

---

### For Windows VPS

1. Press **Ctrl + Alt + End** (or use the on-screen keyboard if you’re on macOS).
2. Click **Change a password**.
3. Enter your **old password**, then your **new password** twice.
4. Press **Enter** to confirm.

Your new password will take effect immediately — make sure to store it securely (e.g., in a password manager).



## 5. Update Your System

Always begin by installing the latest updates and patches.

**Debian / Ubuntu**

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

**AlmaLinux / Rocky / CentOS**

```bash
dnf update -y
```

Keeping your system updated ensures security and stability.

## 6. Set Hostname and Reverse DNS (Optional)

Set a custom hostname for your VPS:

```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname myserver.example.com
```

To configure reverse DNS (PTR record), use the **rDNS* section in your dashboard.
A matching hostname and PTR record help improve email deliverability and server reputation.

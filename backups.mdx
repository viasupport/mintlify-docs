# Protecting Your VPS Data

<Info>
  EDBB keeps the hypervisor stable but does <strong>not</strong> ship VPS plans with automatic snapshots or backups. You decide how, where, and how often to protect your own data.

## Why It Matters

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="🛡️ You Own the Recovery Plan">
    Operating system files, application configs, and customer data are your responsibility. Schedule backups before you need them.
  </Card>
  <Card title="⚡ Incidents Happen">
    Hardware faults, accidental deletes, or security breaches can strike without warning. Prepared backups mean rapid recovery.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🌍 Off-Site Saves the Day">
    Keep at least one copy outside the VPS—object storage, another data centre, or your own infrastructure.

## Build a Backup Routine

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your tooling">
    Decide between snapshot-like full images (<code>dd</code>, <code>qemu-img</code>), file-level backups (<code>tar</code>, <code>rsync</code>), or sync tools (<code>rclone</code>, <code>restic</code>).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automate the cadence">
    Use cron jobs or orchestration pipelines so backups run daily or weekly without manual steps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify and rotate">
    Test restores periodically and prune old archives so you always have a clean, recent copy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Requesting a Downloadable Image

<Info>
  Instant snapshots are not included, but you can request a downloadable <code>.qcow2</code> image of your VPS disk. Each export costs <strong>€25</strong> to cover handling.
</Info>

- Contact Support via the portal messenger or by email with the VPS ID and timeframe.  
- We prepare the image and provide a secure download link.  
- Download promptly—links expire to keep data safe.

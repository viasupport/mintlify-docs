## Protecting Your VPS Data

EDBB does not provide any backup services for VPS. \
It is important that you manage your own backups to protect your data.

## **What this means for you:**

🛡 **You are responsible** for creating backups of your server and all important data. \
🛡 We recommend scheduling regular backups to ensure your data is safe.

### **Why Regular Backups Are Essential for Your VPS Data Protection**

Regular backups are essential for protecting your data against hardware failures, accidental deletions, or cyber threats. Without proper backups, you risk losing critical data, leading to costly downtime or permanent data loss. By scheduling regular backups, you safeguard your systems, enabling quick recovery and uninterrupted operations, minimizing significant disruptions.

## Why It Matters

## Build a Reliable Backup Routine 💾

Keeping consistent, verified backups ensures that even if your VPS faces corruption, accidental deletion, or intrusion, you can recover quickly with minimal data loss.

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Choose the right backup type and tool">
    Decide which backup method best fits your needs:

    - **Image-level backups (snapshots):** capture an entire disk or VPS state. Ideal for full restores.  
      Tools: <code>dd</code>, <code>qemu-img</code>, or platform-level snapshots.

    - **File-level backups:** back up only selected files or directories. Perfect for web apps, configs, or databases.  
      Tools: <code>tar</code>, <code>rsync</code>.

    - **Incremental or cloud sync backups:** store data efficiently across cloud providers. Great for redundancy.  
      Tools: <code>rclone</code>, <code>restic</code>, <code>borg</code>.
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Automate the schedule">
    Manual backups are easy to forget — automate them using cron or systemd timers.

    **Example (daily at 2:30 AM):**
    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```
    Then add:
    ```bash
    30 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh >> /var/log/backup.log 2>&1
    ```

    You can also automate remote syncs to cloud storage or a second VPS:
    ```bash
    rclone sync /var/www remote:backups/server1 --exclude "cache/**"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Verify integrity and rotate backups">
    A backup is only useful if it restores correctly.

    - **Verify checksums:** compare SHA256 or MD5 hashes of backup files regularly.
    - **Test restores:** mount or extract backups in a temporary directory to confirm data integrity.
    - **Rotate old backups:** remove archives older than 30 days to save space.  
      Example:
      ```bash
      find /backups -type f -mtime +30 -delete
      ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Store copies offsite">
    Never rely on a single server for all backups.

    - Keep one local copy for quick restores.  
    - Sync another to an external or cloud location (S3, Backblaze, Google Drive, etc.).  
    - Encrypt sensitive data before transfer using <code>gpg</code> or <code>restic --password-command</code>.

    💡 *Tip:* Apply the **3-2-1 rule** — 3 copies, 2 storage types, 1 offsite.
  </Step>
</Steps>

✅ With a reliable, automated backup routine, you can restore your VPS or applications confidently — even after hardware failure, misconfiguration, or a security breach.

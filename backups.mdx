## Protecting Your VPS Data

EDBB does not provide any backup services for VPS. \
It is important that you manage your own backups to protect your data.

## **What this means for you:**

🛡 **You are responsible** for creating backups of your server and all important data. \
🛡 We recommend scheduling regular backups to ensure your data is safe.

### **Why Regular Backups Are Essential for Your VPS Data Protection**

Regular backups are essential for protecting your data against hardware failures, accidental deletions, or cyber threats. Without proper backups, you risk losing critical data, leading to costly downtime or permanent data loss. By scheduling regular backups, you safeguard your systems, enabling quick recovery and uninterrupted operations, minimizing significant disruptions.

## Why It Matters

  <Card title="🛡️ You Own the Recovery Plan">
    Operating system files, application configs, and customer data are your responsibility. Schedule backups before you need them.

  <Card title="⚡ Incidents Happen">
    Hardware faults, accidental deletes, or security breaches can strike without warning. Prepared backups mean rapid recovery.

  <Card title="🌍 Off-Site Saves the Day">
    Keep at least one copy outside the VPS—object storage, another data centre, or your own infrastructure.

## Build a Backup Routine

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your tooling">
    Decide between snapshot-like full images (

    ,  dd\
    , qemu-img

    ), file-level backups (<code>
     tar</code>

    , <code>
     rsync</code>

    ), or sync tools (<code>
     rclone</code>

    , <code>
     restic</code>

    ).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automate the cadence">
    Use cron jobs or orchestration pipelines so backups run daily or weekly without having to trigger the process manually.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify and rotate">
    Test restores periodically and prune old archives so you always have a clean, recent copy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

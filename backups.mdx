## You're in Charge of Backups

EDBB prioritizes infrastructure stability, but by design we **do not include snapshot or backup services** for VPS plans built on KVM virtualization.  
That means you control how, where, and when your data is protected.

### What This Implies

- 🛡 **You’re responsible** for backing up operating systems, configuration files, and application data.
- 🛡 Schedule backups on a routine cadence so recovery isn’t left to chance.

### Why Routine Backups Matter

Hardware issues, accidental deletions, and security incidents happen.  
With a reliable backup strategy, you can restore quickly, limit downtime, and avoid permanent data loss.

### How to Back Up and Restore

Our guide, [Backup and Restore Data on Linux](https://docs.edbb.com/backup-restore-data-linux), covers practical approaches including `tar`, `rsync`, `dd`, and `rclone` for off-site storage. Follow the step-by-step instructions that fit your tooling preferences.

### Need a .qcow2 Image?

While instant snapshots aren’t part of the service, you can request a downloadable `.qcow2` image of your virtual disk. A processing fee of **EUR 25** applies.

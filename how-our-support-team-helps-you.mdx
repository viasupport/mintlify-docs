## Where the Line Is Drawn

To protect your privacy and maintain a clean security posture, support **will not**:

- Sign in to your VPS or any downstream systems
- Install or remove applications on your behalf
- Edit configuration files, firewall rules, or open ports
- Reset passwords or alter user roles within your instance
- Move customer data between servers or accounts

EDBB delivers the infrastructure; **you remain the administrator** of the operating system itself.

## Getting Additional Assistance

1. **Dive into EDBB Docs** 📘  
   Our [documentation portal](https://docs.edbb.com) houses implementation guides, common fixes, and how-tos.

2. **Hire a Systems Professional** 👩‍💻  
   For custom stacks, migrations, or advanced configurations, collaborate with an independent system administrator.

3. **Learn from the Community** 🌍

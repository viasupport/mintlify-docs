## **Support Boundaries for Your Security 🚫**

To ensure your privacy and security, our infrastructure-focused support does not include:

- Logging into your VPS, databases or downstream services
- Installing software or patches
- Changing configurations
- Updating passwords or ports
- Migrating servers to another account or location

We strictly operate as an infrastructure provider and do not access customer servers or perform software configurations. This ensures your data remains secure and private.

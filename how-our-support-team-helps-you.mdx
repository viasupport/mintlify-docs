## Your Responsibilities as VPS Administrator

To protect customer privacy and preserve a clean security posture, there are tasks only you (or someone you authorise) should perform.

<Info>
  ⚠️ EDBB Support does <strong>not</strong>:
  <ul>
    <li>Log in to your VPS, databases, or downstream services</li>
    <li>Install packages, edit configuration files, or apply operating system patches</li>
    <li>Open firewall ports, alter security groups, or transfer customer data</li>
    <li>Change system-level passwords or manage user accounts inside your instance</li>
  </ul>
</Info>

You keep the admin keys; we make sure the surrounding infrastructure and tooling stay reliable.

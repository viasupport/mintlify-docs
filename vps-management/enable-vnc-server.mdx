# Enable VNC for Console Access

<Info>
  VNC provides a screen-and-keyboard view of your VPS even when SSH or RDP is unavailable. Enable it only while you need interactive console access and turn it off afterward.

## Step 2 – Open the Console

- Click <strong>Open Console</strong> to launch the browser-based console. No password is required for this view—just click inside the window to capture keyboard and mouse input.

## Step 3 – Disable VNC When Finished

<Steps>
  <Step title="Toggle VNC off">
    Open the dropdown beside <strong>VNC On</strong> and choose <strong>Disable VNC</strong> once you’re done troubleshooting or installing software.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm access paths">
    After disabling VNC, reconnect using SSH or RDP as normal. The console will no longer be accessible until you enable VNC again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Leaving VNC enabled exposes an additional attack surface. Disable it when you’re finished to keep the VPS secure.
</Callout>

You can now confidently toggle VNC on and off whenever you need direct console access to your EDBB VPS.

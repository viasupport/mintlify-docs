## Locate Your Support PIN

<Info>
  The Support PIN proves account ownership when you contact EDBB about billing,
  security, or sensitive service changes. Treat it like any other secret: share it
  only with trusted teammates and rotate it if you suspect exposure.

## When Support Will Ask for the PIN

- 🔐 **Account validation** – identity checks for billing adjustments, contact updates, or GDPR-related requests.  
- 🛠️ **Sensitive changes** – rDNS edits, reverse DNS delegation, or provisioning additional IPs through the support desk.  
- 🚨 **Security escalations** – suspicious login reports, suspected compromise, or ownership challenges.

Providing the PIN with your first message speeds up verification so we can action the request without back-and-forth.

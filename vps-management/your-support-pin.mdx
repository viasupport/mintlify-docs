## Step 2 – Know When We’ll Ask for It

- Live chat or email requests involving billing, contact changes, or ownership questions.  
- Resetting panel access, modifying rDNS, or attaching private data when messaging Support.  
- Any time you need to prove identity before we discuss sensitive information.

Providing the PIN speeds up verification so we can process your request immediately.

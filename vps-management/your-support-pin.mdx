# Manage Your Support PIN

Every VPS has a unique Support PIN. We ask for this code whenever you need sensitive assistance—like changing account contacts, requesting manual interventions, or verifying ownership over chat.

## When Support Will Ask for the PIN

- Live chat or ticket escalations that touch billing, contacts, or ownership
- Requests to reset panel access, modify rDNS delegations, or attach private data
- Any time your email address or telephone number on file needs to be updated

Sharing the correct PIN lets us process verified requests without additional paperwork.

---

## Keep the PIN Secure

- Store the code in your team password manager instead of emailing it around.
- Rotate the support contact list when staff changes so only current admins have access.
- Never publish the PIN in public issue trackers or shared screenshots.

If you suspect the PIN is compromised, open a ticket—we will invalidate it and issue a fresh code immediately.

## IPv6 on EDBB VPS

<Info>
  Every VPS includes a dedicated <strong>/64 equivalent</strong> IPv6 range. Routing to the gateway requires configuring addresses with a <strong>/48 prefix</strong> inside your operating system.
</Info>

## Step 1 – Grab the Details from the Control Panel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Network tab">
    Sign in to the <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank">EDBB Control Panel</a>, select your VPS, and open the <strong>Network</strong> tab. Copy the IPv6 assignment and gateway.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Note the DNS entries">
    The Network tab also lists recommended IPv4/IPv6 resolvers—use them if you want dual-stack name resolution.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2 – Add an IPv6 Address (Linux example)

```bash
# Pick an address from your /64 equivalent
sudo ip -6 addr add 2a03:f80:ed15:82ca::10/48 dev eth0

# Add the default route using the gateway from the portal
sudo ip -6 route add default via 2a03:f80:ed15::1
```

Verify the configuration:

```bash
ip -6 addr show dev eth0
ip -6 route show
```

Persist the settings using your distro’s network tooling (Netplan, NetworkManager, or <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>).

<Callout type="warning">
  Always use the <strong>/48 prefix</strong> when configuring addresses so traffic can reach the gateway. Using /64 in the OS will prevent routing.
</Callout>

## Step 3 – Test Connectivity

```bash
ping6 2a03:f80:ed15::1         # Ping the gateway
ping6 ipv6.google.com
```

If gateway pings work but external hosts fail, review firewall rules or DNS configuration.

## Best Practices

- Document the assigned /64 range and gateway for quick reference.  
- Limit the number of active IPv6 addresses to avoid triggering flood protection.  
- Combine IPv6 with IPv4 so services stay reachable for clients without IPv6.  
- If routing issues persist, follow the <a href="/vps-management/basic-ipv6-troubleshooting">IPv6 troubleshooting guide</a>.

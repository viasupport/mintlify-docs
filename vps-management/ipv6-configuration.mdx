## Understand Your IPv6 Allocation

Every EDBB VPS ships with a dedicated `/64` IPv6 subnet. One address from that range is preloaded on your main interface, so you can begin using IPv6 immediately.

You can view the full allocation, gateway, and DNS servers in the **IP Settings** card inside the [EDBB VPS Portal](https://my.edbb.com). That information is also available inside the server under `/etc/network/` or `/etc/netplan/`, depending on your distribution.

If you want to assign additional IPv6 addresses or swap to a different address within your `/64`, configure them manually inside the guest OS. The exact commands vary by distribution; the examples below use standard Linux tooling.

In Debian and Ubuntu releases, the `ip` command offers the quickest way to test address changes at runtime before making them persistent.

<Note>
  When adding extra addresses, set the prefix length to `/48` as shown in the examples.
</Note>

Configure an IPv6 address at runtime:

```bash
ip -6 addr add 2a03:f80:ed15:435a::1/48 dev eth0
```

Display configured IPv6 addresses:

```bash
ip -6 addr show
```

Persist the change by adding the address to `/etc/network/interfaces`, a Netplan YAML file, or the relevant NetworkManager profile, depending on your distro.

## Set the IPv6 Default Route

To enable external IPv6 communication, a default route or default gateway must be configured.

Configure an IPv6 default route:

```bash
ip -6 route add default via 2a03:f80:ed15::1
```

<Note>
  The default gateway differs by location. Replace the example address with the gateway listed for your VPS in the EDBB VPS Portal.
</Note>

Display the active IPv6 routes:

```bash
ip -6 route show
```

Persist the gateway in the same configuration file you used for the address so the route survives reboots.

## Verify Connectivity

After updating addresses and routes, confirm that IPv6 traffic flows as expected:

```bash
ping6 2a03:f80:ed15::1
ping6 ipv6.google.com
```

If the ping to the gateway succeeds but external hosts fail, double-check firewall rules and DNS configuration.

## Good Practices

- Store your `/64` details and gateway in your documentation for quick reference.  
- Limit the number of active IPv6 addresses to what you actually need to avoid hitting flood protection.  
- Combine IPv6 with IPv4 wherever possible so services remain reachable for clients without IPv6 support.  
- Review the [EDBB IPv6 troubleshooting guide](https://docs.edbb.com/vps-management/basic-ipv6-troubleshooting) if you encounter packet loss or routing issues.

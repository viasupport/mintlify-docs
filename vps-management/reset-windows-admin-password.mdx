# Reset the Windows Administrator Password

<Info>
  Every EDBB Windows VPS includes a password-helper ISO. Booting from it lets you clear the local SAM database and set a new Administrator password without reinstalling the operating system.

## Before You Begin

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="🔐 Portal Access">
    Confirm you can sign in to the <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank">EDBB VPS Portal</a>. You’ll manage the entire workflow from the service dashboard.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🕒 Restart Window">
    Allow a short maintenance window—the VPS reboots once into the helper ISO and once back into Windows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🔑 New Password Ready">
    Prepare a strong replacement password in your manager so you can paste it the moment Windows unlocks.

The VPS restarts automatically and boots back into Windows with the Administrator password cleared.

<Callout type="warning">
  Store the new password immediately—EDBB does not resend credentials. Treat the helper ISO as temporary; leave it mounted only while you complete the reset.
</Callout>

## Step 4 – Sign In and Set a New Password

1. After the reboot, Windows signs in without asking for a password.  
2. Launch **Command Prompt** as Administrator.

3. Run the following command, replacing `NewStrongPassword!` with your chosen value:

```shell
net user Administrator "NewStrongPassword!"
```

## Step 5 – Return to Normal Boot

<Steps>
  <Step title="Unmount the ISO">
    Back in <strong>Installation → ISO Boot</strong>, click <strong>Unmount</strong> so Windows boots from disk next time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disable VNC">
    Toggle VNC back off if you only needed it for the reset.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update records">
    Store the new credential in your password manager and update any internal runbooks.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Forgetting the Windows Administrator password is inconvenient, but you can recover quickly without reinstalling your VPS.  
EDBB provides a password helper ISO that unlocks the local SAM database so you can sign back in and set a new password.  
This walkthrough replaces the old credential and guides you through the post-reset clean-up.

---

## Preparation Checklist

- Confirm you can access the [EDBB VPS Portal](https://my.edbb.com).  
- Expect the VPS to reboot once during the procedure.  
- Have a replacement Administrator password ready to assign at the end.

<Info>
The helper ISO briefly boots the server into an offline environment.  
It modifies the Windows account database so you can log in without knowing the previous password.

## Step 1 — Open the EDBB VPS Portal

1. Visit [https://my.edbb.com](https://my.edbb.com) and sign in.  
2. From **Services**, choose the Windows VPS that requires recovery.  
3. Make sure the instance is running; the portal forces a reboot when you attach the helper ISO.

## Step 2 — Attach the Password Helper ISO

1. [Enable VNC access](https://docs.edbb.com/enable-vnc-server) if the console is disabled.  
2. Select **Mount ISO** and follow the [mounting flow](https://docs.edbb.com/mount-iso-image).  
3. Choose **1_Password-Reset-Helper.iso**.  
4. Tick **Force reset & boot from the selected ISO**, then press **Mount ISO**.  
5. Wait while the VPS restarts from the helper image.  
6. Launch the built-in noVNC session or connect with a VNC viewer to monitor the console.

The server will restart automatically and boot back into Windows.

## Step 4 — Sign In and Set a New Password

1. After the reboot, Windows signs in without prompting for a password.  
2. Launch **Command Prompt** as Administrator.

3. Run the following command, replacing `NewStrongPassword!` with your chosen value:

```shell
net user Administrator "NewStrongPassword!"
```

4. Close the command window and log off, then sign back in to confirm the new password works.

## Step 5 — Detach the ISO and Lock Down Access

1. Return to the portal and [unmount the helper ISO](https://docs.edbb.com/mount-iso-image) so future reboots use the local disk.  
2. [Disable VNC access](https://docs.edbb.com/enable-vnc-server) if you no longer need console access.  
3. Update any password managers or internal documentation with the new credentials.

## Next Steps

- Consider enabling multi-factor logons for administrative accounts.  
- Review user accounts periodically to ensure former staff or contractors are removed.  
- Keep this guide in your incident response folder for future reference.

With these steps complete, you’ve restored control of the Windows Administrator account on your EDBB VPS without touching the operating system installation.

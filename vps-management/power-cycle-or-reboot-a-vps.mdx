## Clean & Safe Shutdown (and Start)

You can trigger a shutdown with **`shutdown -h now`** or **`halt`** inside the OS, then click **Start** in the EDBB portal to power it back on. This is the preferred method for a clean cold boot.

## Start / Stop and Restart Buttons

If your service is currently in **SHUTDOWN** state, you can **Start** your VPS from the portal.
Regardless of the current state, you always have the option to **Restart** your VPS.

## Stop and Restart from a technical perspective

Both the **Stop** and **Restart** buttons terminate the hypervisor process which is managing your VPS. In addition, a Restart also initiates a fresh start of your virtual machine on a new hypervisor process. if you had a VNC/noVNC console open, you need to restart VNC/noVNC console too.
Please always consider a clean shutdown through your operating system first!

<Note>
  Prefer graceful reboots whenever possible: run <code>sudo shutdown -h now</code> or <code>sudo halt</code> inside Linux (or the equivalent command in Windows), then start the VPS from the Control Panel. This keeps filesystems and services healthy before you resort to a forced power cycle.
</Note>

## Restart a Running VPS

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the VPS Control Panel">
    Sign in to the <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank">EDBB Control Panel</a>, go to <strong>Services</strong>, and select the VPS you want to reboot.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Restart">
    Click the arrow next to the green <strong>Server On</strong> button and select <strong>Restart Server</strong>. The VPS powers off and back on in one action.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Restart performs an immediate power cycle at the hypervisor level. If the operating system still responds, run its built-in reboot command first for a graceful shutdown.
</Callout>

## Stop VPS

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the power controls">
    From the same dropdown next to <strong>Server On</strong>, choose <strong>Stop Server</strong> to shut the VPS down.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for the state to change">
    The service status switches to <strong>Stopped</strong> once the hypervisor powers it off. Console access ends immediately.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Reconnect">
    Once the status changes to <strong>Running</strong>, reopen the console or reconnect over SSH/RDP to resume work.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Stop is equivalent to pulling the power cable. Use it only if the guest OS no longer reacts to `shutdown` or `poweroff` commands.
</Callout>

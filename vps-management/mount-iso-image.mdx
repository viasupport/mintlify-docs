## Mount ISO Images from the Control Panel

<Info>
  Mounting an ISO temporarily changes the boot order. Be ready for the VPS to reboot and save any work before you proceed.

## Use the EDBB ISO Library

  <Step title="Open the Installation tab">
    From your VPS Control Panel, switch to <strong>Installation</strong>, then the <strong>ISO Boot</strong> sub-tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pick an ISO">
    Choose from the built-in helper images (Linux rescue tools, Windows password helper, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mount & reboot">
    Tick <strong>Force reset & boot from the selected ISO</strong>, then click <strong>Mount ISO</strong>. The VPS reboots automatically into that image.

## Work from the Console

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch the console">
    Click <strong>Open Console</strong> to open the portal console (or connect with your VNC client).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow boot prompts">
    Most ISOs ask you to press a key quickly—watch the console so you don't miss the prompt.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Finish your tasks">
    Complete the installer or recovery steps. Leave the ISO mounted if you need multiple restarts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Unmount When Finished

<Steps>
  <Step title="Return to ISO Boot">
    Go back to <strong>Installation → ISO Boot</strong>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unmount">
    Click <strong>Unmount</strong> (or switch to <strong>Boot from local disk</strong>) so the VPS boots normally next time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reboot if needed">
    Use the <strong>Server On</strong> menu to restart the VPS from disk and disable VNC if you no longer need console access.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Unmounting ensures the VPS returns to its local disk on the next restart.

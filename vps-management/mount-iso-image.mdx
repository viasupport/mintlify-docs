# Mount ISO Images from the EDBB Portal

Mounting an ISO lets you boot live recovery environments, run custom installers, or access vendor-provided utilities without wiping your VPS. The EDBB portal exposes the full workflow—no out-of-band tools required.

---

## Before You Mount Anything

- Sign in to the [EDBB VPS Portal](https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php).  
- Confirm the VPS is powered on and that you have console access (enable noVNC if it is currently disabled).  
- Keep downtime in mind: forcing an ISO boot will reboot the instance immediately.

## Option 1 — Use the EDBB ISO Library

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the service record">
    Go to **Services → Your VPS → ISO Images**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pick an ISO from the list">
    Choose the Linux or Windows helper image you need.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Force the reboot">
    Tick **Force reset & boot from the selected ISO** and press **Mount ISO**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The portal reboots the VPS and attaches the ISO as the primary boot device.

## Option 2 — Mount Your Own ISO

Need a custom installer or vendor toolkit? Upload it via the custom ISO workflow, then return here to mount it.

<CtaButton label="Upload a Custom ISO" link="./bring-your-own-iso" />

Once uploaded, the file appears alongside the standard images—select it and mount as described above.

## Boot from the ISO and Work in the Console

1. Launch the web console (noVNC) or your preferred VNC client.  
2. Watch the boot order; most images prompt you to press a key within a few seconds.  
3. Complete your install, recovery, or diagnostic tasks as needed.  
4. If the ISO requires multiple reboots, leave it mounted until you finish.

---

## Detach the ISO When You Are Done

1. Return to the portal’s **ISO Images** panel.  
2. Click **Unmount ISO** (or switch back to **Boot from local disk** if available).  
3. Reboot one final time so the VPS starts from its virtual disk.  
4. Disable VNC access again if you do not need an interactive console.

Unmounting ensures the VPS boots normally on the next restart and closes any lingering live environments.

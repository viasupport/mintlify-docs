## What You’ll See

- **Primary IPv4** plus any additional addresses that belong to the VPS  
- **Dedicated /64 IPv6** block, including the auto-configured address currently active on the NIC  
- **Default gateways** for IPv4 and IPv6 so you can configure static routes inside the OS  
- **Reverse DNS status** with quick links to edit PTR records  
- **Nameserver entries** that match the configuration supplied by the hypervisor

Use this view as the source of truth whenever you reconfigure networking inside the guest operating system.

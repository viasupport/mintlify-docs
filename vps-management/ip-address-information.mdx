## Tips for Using the Data

- Configure additional IPv4 addresses using the subnet mask and gateway shown. Use only one gateway in your OS configuration.  
- For IPv6, assign addresses from your range and route traffic through the listed gateway using a /48 prefix.  
- Apply DNS entries directly in your operating system or cloud-init user-data so services resolve correctly.  
- Need to change or order more addresses? Follow the <a href="/faq/ip-addresses/change-ip-address">Change IP</a> or <a href="/faq/ip-addresses/order-additional-ip-address">Order Additional IPv4</a> guides.

# Change the IPv4 Address in Windows Server

<Info>
  Before editing Windows networking, note the IPv4 address, subnet, gateway, and DNS values from the EDBB portal. Changing settings interrupts connectivity—plan a brief maintenance window.
</Info>

## Step 1 – Collect the New Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Network tab">
    Sign in to the <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank">EDBB VPS Portal</a> and open the <strong>Network</strong> tab on your VPS. Record the IPv4 details exactly as shown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decide on additional IPs">
    If multiple addresses are assigned, choose which will be primary (outbound) and which will be secondary.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 2 – Connect to the Server

- Use an RDP session if the current address is reachable.  
- If the old IP is already removed, enable VNC in the quick actions and click <strong>Open Console</strong> to work from the portal console.

---

## Step 3 – Open Adapter Properties

1. Press `Win + R`, type `ncpa.cpl`, and press **Enter**. The **Network Connections** window opens.  
2. Right-click your main adapter (typically **Ethernet**) and choose **Properties**.

## Step 4 – Enter the New IPv4 Values

1. Highlight **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and click **Properties**.  
2. Select **Use the following IP address** and input the data from the portal (IP, subnet mask, default gateway).  
3. If DNS servers are listed, choose **Use the following DNS server addresses** and add them.

Click **OK**, then **Close** to apply the configuration.

<Tip>
Need to assign secondary IPs? Click **Advanced…** in the IPv4 properties dialog and add them under <strong>IP settings</strong>.
</Tip>

## Step 5 – Verify with PowerShell

Open PowerShell as Administrator and confirm the new values:

```powershell
Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 | Format-Table InterfaceAlias,IPAddress,PrefixLength
Get-NetIPConfiguration | Format-List InterfaceAlias,IPv4DefaultGateway,DNSServer
```

If something looks wrong, reopen the adapter properties and correct it.

---

## Step 6 – Test Connectivity

```powershell
ping 203.0.113.1       # replace with your gateway
ping edbb.com
```

Reconnect via RDP using the new IPv4 address once pings succeed. Disable VNC if you only enabled it for this change.

---

## Automation Option

Use PowerShell for scripted changes (update values before running):

```powershell
$iface = 'Ethernet'
Remove-NetIPAddress -InterfaceAlias $iface -AddressFamily IPv4 -Confirm:$false
New-NetIPAddress -InterfaceAlias $iface -IPAddress '203.0.113.50' -PrefixLength 24 -DefaultGateway '203.0.113.1'
Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias $iface -ServerAddresses @('203.0.113.2','8.8.8.8')
```

---

## Final Checklist

- Update firewalls, monitoring, and documentation with the new IP.  
- Restart services that bind to the old address (IIS sites, databases, etc.).  
- Confirm scheduled tasks or backup jobs that reference the IP have been refreshed.

Your Windows Server now uses the new IPv4 settings supplied by EDBB.

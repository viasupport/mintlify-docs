Need to swap the public IPv4 address on your Windows Server VPS?  
The process only takes a few minutes through the Windows GUI or PowerShell. Follow the steps below while connected through RDP or the EDBB VNC console.

---

## 1. Collect the New Network Settings

1. Sign in to the [EDBB VPS Portal](https://my.edbb.com).  
2. Open your VPS and expand **IP Settings** to view the assigned IPv4 address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS servers.  
3. Keep this data handy; you will enter it exactly as shown inside Windows.

---

## 2. Connect to the Server Console

- Use a normal RDP session if the current IP is still reachable.  
- If you are mid-migration or the IP was already removed, enable the [VNC console](https://docs.edbb.com/vps-management/enable-vnc-server) from the portal and authenticate using the Windows credentials.

Once you see the desktop, continue with the graphical instructions below.

## 3. Open Network Adapter Settings

1. Press `Win + R`, type `ncpa.cpl`, and press **Enter**. This opens the **Network Connections** window.  
2. Right-click your primary adapter (typically **Ethernet**) and choose **Properties**.

## 4. Apply the New IPv4 Address

1. Highlight **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and click **Properties**.  
2. Select **Use the following IP address** and enter the values collected from the portal:
   - **IP address**: `203.0.113.50`
   - **Subnet mask**: `255.255.255.0`
   - **Default gateway**: `203.0.113.1`
3. If DNS servers are provided, choose **Use the following DNS server addresses** and add them (for example, `203.0.113.2` and `8.8.8.8`).

Click **OK**, then **Close** to apply the changes.

<Tip>
If you need to add a secondary IP, click **Advanced…** inside the IPv4 properties dialog and append additional addresses in the **IP Settings** tab.
</Tip>

## 5. Verify with PowerShell

Open **PowerShell** as Administrator (`Start` > search for PowerShell > **Run as administrator**) and confirm the new values:

```powershell
Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 | Format-Table InterfaceAlias,IPAddress,PrefixLength
Get-NetIPConfiguration | Format-List InterfaceAlias,IPv4DefaultGateway,DNSServer
```

If anything looks incorrect, reopen the adapter properties and adjust accordingly.

---

## 6. Test Connectivity

- Run `ping` against the default gateway and a public host:

```powershell
ping 203.0.113.1
ping edbb.com
```

- Launch the applications or services that rely on the new address to ensure they bind correctly. Restart services if required.

Once confirmed, disable the VNC console in the portal to close the maintenance window.

---

## Optional: Use PowerShell for Scripted Changes

Prefer automation? The following commands replace the existing IPv4 address and gateway in one pass. Update the interface name and networking values first:

```powershell
$iface = 'Ethernet'
Remove-NetIPAddress -InterfaceAlias $iface -AddressFamily IPv4 -Confirm:$false
New-NetIPAddress -InterfaceAlias $iface -IPAddress '203.0.113.50' -PrefixLength 24 -DefaultGateway '203.0.113.1'
Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceAlias $iface -ServerAddresses @('203.0.113.2','8.8.8.8')
```

This approach is especially helpful when preparing scripts for multiple servers.

## Final Checklist

- [ ] Document the change and update monitoring or firewall rules.  
- [ ] Ensure scheduled tasks, backup jobs, or licensing tools that reference the IP are refreshed.  
- [ ] Remove any temporary firewall allowances or VNC sessions used during the update.

You’ve successfully migrated the Windows Server IPv4 configuration to the new values supplied by EDBB.

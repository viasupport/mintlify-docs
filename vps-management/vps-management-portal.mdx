## What You’ll Find on the Service Dashboard

- **Status & console controls** – power on/off, soft reboot, live screenshots, and a launch button for the built-in noVNC console.  
- **System configuration dialog** – adjust CPU topology (cores vs. sockets), BIOS type, boot sequence, and NIC model without opening a ticket.  
- **ISO management** – mount helper images, <a href="./mount-iso-image">boot recovery tools</a>, or <a href="./bring-your-own-iso">upload a custom ISO</a>.  
- **Automated reinstalls** – redeploy Linux and Windows templates in minutes with Cloud-Init or unattended setups.  
- **Network information** – review IPv4/IPv6 assignments, request <a href="../faq/ip-addresses/setting-up-reverse-pointers">reverse DNS changes</a>, and inspect traffic usage.  
- **Support credentials** – copy the Support PIN before opening a chat so our engineers can verify ownership quickly.

## Power & Recovery

- Trigger graceful reboots or emergency power-off commands if the guest OS stops responding.  
- Enable temporary VNC access for console-level troubleshooting.  
- Mount password-reset or rescue ISOs to recover access without reinstalling.  
- Schedule reinstalls with your own Cloud-Init user-data or post-install scripts.

## Billing & Traffic Insights

- See the next renewal date and open invoices for the selected service.  
- Track monthly bandwidth, hydration events, and remaining pool balance.  
- Order additional resources—IPv4 addresses, RAM, CPU upgrades—without leaving the portal.

## Stay Organized

- Use the tagging and notes fields to document the role of each VPS.  
- Export traffic reports for compliance or chargeback purposes.  
- Manage contact details so the right people receive downtime or invoice alerts.

When you’re ready to remove a server, the portal also handles the entire cancellation workflow—see <a href="/faq/billing-lifecycle/cancel-a-service">Cancel an EDBB VPS</a> for the checklist.

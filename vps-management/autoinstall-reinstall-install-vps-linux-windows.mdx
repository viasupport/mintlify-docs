## Installation Time & Port Behavior

Once the reinstallation starts, your VPS will go through the automated setup process. The image below shows the typical duration and port behavior for each operating system:

![Installation times for Linux and Windows](/assets/windows-linux-install-time-ports-closed.png)

<Note>
  During reinstallation, **remote access (SSH/RDP)** is temporarily disabled while your VPS is being rebuilt.\
  You’ll be able to connect again once the installation has finished — typically after **≈ 5 minutes for Linux** or **≈ 15 minutes for Windows**.

  ⚠️ **Do not power off or reboot your VPS** during this time, as it may interrupt the OS setup.
</Note>

## Installation via Cloud-Init

Prefer your own image or automated bootstrap? Use **Cloud-Init** to upload a qcow2 template and supply user-data for first boot.

<Note>
  Cloud-Init is ideal when you need to:\
  • deploy a custom or pre-configured image\
  • automate user creation, SSH keys, or initial setup commands\
  • keep full control over image configuration

  For standard Linux or Windows builds, the **AutoInstall OS** option remains the quickest route.
</Note>

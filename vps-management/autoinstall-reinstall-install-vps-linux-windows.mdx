## Track Progress - then Connect

| OS          | Approx. time | What happens / What to do                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Linux**   | **≈ 5 min**  | AutoInstall provisions and reboots automatically — no extra clicks required. SSH is blocked during installation. Linux typically finishes installation in 5 minutes. When the status changes to _Running_, connect via **SSH** using the new root password. |
| **Windows** | **≈ 15 min** | RDP access is blocked during installation. When the status changes to _Running_, connect via **RDP** using the new Administrator password. Windows usually takes 15 minutes to install.                                                                     |

<info>
  The **Installation** tab streams logs while the image is provisioned. SSH/RDP ports stay closed until the job finishes.\
  ⚠️ Do **not** power off or reboot the VPS manually — AutoInstall restarts it automatically when the OS is ready.

## Install a Custom Image 

Prefer to Bring Your Own .qcow2 image and/or run a cloud-init automation? Use the Cloud-Init workflow to keep full control over first boot actions.

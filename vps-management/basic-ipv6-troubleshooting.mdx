## IPv6 Troubleshooting Playbook

<Info>
  IPv6 relies on the address, gateway, and DNS values shown on the Network tab. Confirm those details first, then follow these quick checks to restore connectivity.
</Info>

## Step 1 – Confirm Assigned Values

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the Network tab">
    Open the <strong>Network</strong> tab in the <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank">EDBB Control Panel</a>. Note the IPv6 assignment, gateway, and recommended DNS resolvers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inspect the running config">
    On the VPS, run:

```bash
ip -6 addr show
ip -6 route show
```

    Ensure the assigned address matches your /64 range and that the default route points to the gateway from the Control Panel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Typos (especially missing `/48`) are the most common cause of IPv6 outages. Double-check each segment when editing addresses.
</Warning>

## Step 2 – Verify Interface State

```bash
ip link show dev eth0
```

Replace `eth0` with the correct interface. Look for <code>state UP</code> and <code>LOWER_UP</code>. If the interface is down:

```bash
sudo ip link set eth0 up
```

---

## Step 3 – Test Local Connectivity

```bash
ping6 -c 3 ::1
ping6 -c 3 2a03:f80:xxxx:xxxx::10   # replace with your address
ip -6 neigh show
```

If the neighbor entry for the gateway shows `FAILED`, flush it and retry:

```bash
sudo ip -6 neigh flush all
```

---

## Step 4 – Probe External Reachability

```bash
ping6 -c 3 2a03:f80:ed15::1        # example gateway
ping6 -c 3 ipv6.google.com
traceroute -6 ipv6.google.com
```

Gateway pings succeed but public hosts fail? Review firewalls (both inside the VPS and upstream) and confirm DNS AAAA records exist for your targets.

---

## Step 5 – Check Application Bindings

- Restart services that bind to specific addresses or interfaces (web servers, databases, proxies).  
- Update config files to reference hostnames or `::` rather than a hard-coded old address.  
- Use `ss -ltnp` to confirm listeners are bound to the expected IPv6 socket.

---

## Step 6 – Gather Diagnostics for Support

If problems persist, collect this output before messaging Support (via the portal messenger or email):

```bash
ip -6 addr show
ip -6 route show
ip -6 neigh show
mtr -6 -r ipv6.google.com
```

Include the VPS ID and datacenter location. This confirms whether the issue is local or upstream.

## Preventive Tips

- Save known-good network configs before editing.  
- Limit active IPv6 addresses to avoid router flood protection.  
- Monitor dual-stack services so both IPv4 and IPv6 remain healthy.  
- Need a refresher? Review the <a href="/vps-management/ipv6-configuration">IPv6 configuration guide</a> first.

With these checks you can resolve most IPv6 issues quickly—and have the right data ready if you need escalation.

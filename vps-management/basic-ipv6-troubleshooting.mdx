IPv6 adds reachability to modern networks, but longer addresses and dual-stack setups can make troubleshooting feel unfamiliar.  
Use this checklist whenever IPv6 stops responding on your EDBB VPS.

---

## 1. Confirm the Assigned Details

1. Open the [EDBB VPS Portal](https://my.edbb.com) and verify the `/64` prefix, gateway, and DNS servers under **IP Settings**.  
2. On the server, inspect the current configuration:

```bash
ip -6 addr show
ip -6 route show
```

Ensure the address belongs to your `/64` and that the default route points to the location-specific gateway.

<Warning>
Typos are the #1 cause of IPv6 outages. Double-check each segment when manually editing addresses.
</Warning>

## 2. Validate the Interface State

Run the following to confirm the interface is up and accepting traffic:

```bash
ip link show dev eth0
```

Replace `eth0` with the correct interface name. Look for `state UP` and flags such as `LOWER_UP`. If the interface is down, re-enable it:

```bash
sudo ip link set eth0 up
```

---

## 3. Test Local Connectivity

1. Ping the assigned IPv6 address from the VPS itself:

```bash
ping6 -c 3 ::1
ping6 -c 3 2a03:f80:xxxx:xxxx::1   # replace with your address
```

2. Confirm neighbor discovery sees the gateway:

```bash
ip -6 neigh show
```

If the gateway entry is `FAILED`, restart networking or manually clear the neighbor cache with `ip -6 neigh flush all` before retrying.

---

## 4. Probe External Reachability

Use reliable destinations to check outbound traffic:

```bash
ping6 -c 3 2a03:f80:ed15::1   # example gateway
ping6 -c 3 ipv6.google.com
traceroute -6 ipv6.google.com
```

If gateway pings succeed but public hosts fail, review firewall rules (both inside the VPS and in any external appliances) and confirm DNS has AAAA records for your target.

---

## 5. Inspect Application Bindings

Applications often bind to specific interfaces or addresses. After an address change:

- Restart web servers, database listeners, or proxies so they pick up the new IPv6.  
- Verify configuration files reference hostnames or `::` rather than a hard-coded old address.  
- Check `ss -ltnp` or `netstat -ltnp` to confirm services are listening on the expected IPv6 sockets.

---

## 6. Collect Diagnostics for Support

If issues persist, gather the following output before contacting EDBB support or your network administrator:

```bash
ip -6 addr show
ip -6 route show
ip -6 neigh show
mtr -6 -r ipv6.google.com
```

Attach the results along with the VPS ID and datacenter location. This information speeds up investigations by confirming whether the problem is local to your VM or upstream.

## Preventive Tips

- Save a copy of your working network configuration before making edits.  
- Limit the number of simultaneously active IPv6 addresses to avoid tripping flood protection on the router.  
- Monitor dual-stack services to ensure both IPv4 and IPv6 remain healthy—Grafana, Prometheus, or simple cron scripts can alert you before customers notice an outage.  
- Review the [IPv6 configuration primer](https://docs.edbb.com/vps-management/ipv6-configuration) whenever you deploy a new VPS.

Following these steps resolves most IPv6 problems in minutes and gives you the data needed for deeper analysis when necessary.

Losing the root password does not mean you need to rebuild your server.  
Every EDBB VPS includes a password reset helper ISO that lets you update credentials from the virtual console in just a few minutes.  
Follow the playbook below to regain control without touching your disks or reinstalling the operating system.

---

## Before You Begin

- Make sure you can log in to the [EDBB VPS Portal](https://my.edbb.com).  
- Close any production sessions that might be affected by a reboot.  
- Keep a secure password manager handy so you can store the new credential immediately.

<Info>
The reset workflow depends on a short-lived ISO boot.  
While the helper ISO is attached, the VPS starts from that image instead of the local disk.  
Once the password is updated, you’ll detach the ISO so normal boot resumes.

## Step 1 — Open the EDBB VPS Portal

1. Sign in at [https://my.edbb.com](https://my.edbb.com).  
2. Head to **Services** and select the VPS that needs root access restored.  
3. Confirm the instance is powered on; the helper ISO reboots automatically, so no manual shutdown is required.

## Step 2 — Boot from the Password Helper ISO

1. If the console is disabled, [turn on VNC access](https://docs.edbb.com/enable-vnc-server).  
2. Choose **Mount ISO**, then follow the [mounting instructions](https://docs.edbb.com/mount-iso-image).  
3. Pick **1_Password-Reset-Helper.iso** from the list.  
4. Tick **Force reset & boot from the selected ISO** and click **Mount ISO**.  
5. Wait a few moments while the VPS restarts from the helper image.  
6. Launch the built-in noVNC viewer or connect with your preferred VNC client to watch the boot sequence.

## Step 3 — Set a New Root Password in the Console

1. In noVNC, click inside the window to capture keyboard focus.  
2. Let the helper finish loading—you’ll see an on-screen prompt once it is ready.

## Step 4 — Detach the ISO and Lock Down Access

1. Return to the portal and [unmount the helper ISO](https://docs.edbb.com/mount-iso-image) so future boots load from disk.  
2. [Disable VNC access](https://docs.edbb.com/enable-vnc-server) once you finish testing.  
3. Store the new password securely and distribute it only to trusted administrators.

## Aftercare Tips

- Add SSH keys and disable password logins to prevent repeat lockouts.  
- Schedule periodic credential reviews so stale accounts do not accumulate.  
- Keep a copy of this process with your team’s recovery runbooks for quick reference.

By following these steps, you’ve restored root control without downtime or data loss—your EDBB VPS is back under your command.

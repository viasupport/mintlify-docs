## Reset Root Password with the Helper ISO

<Info>
  Every EDBB VPS ships with a password-helper ISO. Booting from it lets you assign a new root password without reinstalling the operating system or touching your disks.

## Before You Start

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="🔐 Portal Access Ready">
    Confirm you can sign in to the <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank">
    EDBB Control Panel</a>

    . All steps happen from the service dashboard.
  </Card>
  <Card title="💾 Safe Maintenance Window">
    Plan a brief outage. The VPS reboots twice—once to load the helper ISO, once to return to disk.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🔑 New Password Prepared">
    Generate a strong credential (use a password manager) so you can paste it the moment the helper prompts for input.
  </Card>

    , and click <strong>Mount ISO</strong>

<warning>
  Write the password to your manager immediately—EDBB does not resend credentials. Treat the helper ISO as a temporary tool; leave it mounted only while you complete the reset.
</warning>

## Step 4 – Return to Normal Boot

<Steps>
  <Step title="Unmount the ISO">
    Back in the <strong>Installation → ISO Boot</strong>
     tab, click <strong>Unmount</strong>
     so the VPS boots from disk next time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disable console access">
    Turn VNC back off if it is only needed for recovery.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secure the credential">
    Store the new password in your team’s password manager and share it only with trusted administrators.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Aftercare Checklist

- Replace password authentication with SSH keys once you confirm access.
- Review sudo/root accounts regularly to ensure they’re still required.
- Keep a copy of this playbook in your team’s incident response runbook for quick reference.

With the helper ISO unmounted and the new credential saved, your EDBB VPS is back under your control.

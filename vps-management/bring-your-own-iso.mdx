## Bring Your Own ISO

<Info>
  Uploading a custom ISO lets you boot recovery toolkits, bespoke installers, or
  legacy operating systems that are not part of the EDBB library. The upload is
  temporary—plan to install or capture data within the retention window.

## Quick Health Check

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="🌐 Direct Download Link">
    Host the ISO on a public HTTP/HTTPS URL without authentication, captchas, or
    one-time tokens. Object storage with static links works best.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🕒 Maintenance Window">
    The VPS reboots when the ISO is mounted. Schedule a maintenance slot so users
    aren’t surprised by downtime.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🖥️ Console Access">
    Keep the portal console (or your VNC client) ready—you’ll need it to interact
    with the installer once the VPS boots from the image.

## Retention - Cleanup

- Custom ISOs stay available for **24 hours**. Re-upload them if you need another session later.  
- For sensitive media, remove the ISO manually once you finish the installation.  
- Keep local copies—expired files are purged automatically and cannot be restored.

<Callout type="warning">
  Downloads that fail usually indicate an inaccessible URL. Verify the link by
  running <code>curl -I &lt;your-link&gt;</code> from an external network and ensure
  it returns HTTP 200 without redirects.
</Callout>

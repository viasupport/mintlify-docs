# Bring Your Own ISO

Have a custom installer, recovery toolkit, or bare-metal backup? Upload the ISO directly to the EDBB platform and boot it just like a local image.

## Before You Begin

- Confirm the ISO is accessible via a direct HTTP or HTTPS download URL (no redirects, login prompts, or temporary links).  
- Large images can take several minutes to copy into the platform—plan a maintenance window.  
- Keep the VNC console handy; you’ll need it to interact with the installer once the VPS boots from your ISO.

## Upload the ISO to EDBB

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the service dashboard">
    Sign in at <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank">my.edbb.com</a>, go to <strong>Services</strong>, and select the VPS.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch the custom ISO workflow">
    Click <strong>ISO Images</strong> &rarr; <strong>Custom ISO</strong>, then choose <strong>Download ISO</strong>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste the direct download link">
    Provide the full URL to your ISO (for example, <code>https://example.com/images/my-appliance.iso</code>) and confirm.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for the download to finish">
    The portal shows a progress bar. Leave the page open until the status switches to <strong>Ready</strong>.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Uploaded files are stored under an internal name (e.g., `xxxx/iso/KVM_xxxxx.iso`). That filename is what you’ll see when mounting the image.

## Mount and Boot From the ISO

1. Head to the **Mount ISO** tab and pick your newly uploaded file.  
2. Tick **Force reset & boot from the selected ISO**, then press **Mount ISO**.  
3. Launch the noVNC console to watch the boot sequence and interact with the installer.  
4. When you’re finished, return to the portal and unmount the ISO so the VPS boots from disk on the next restart.

## Retention & Housekeeping

- Custom ISOs remain on the platform for **24 hours**. Re-upload them if you need to reuse the image later.  
- Delete the ISO manually after installation if it contains sensitive software or licensing data.  
- Make sure you have a backup copy—ISOs are removed automatically when they expire.

<Note>
  If the download fails to complete, verify that the link is direct (no query redirects) and publicly reachable from the internet. You can host ISOs on any HTTPS-capable object storage bucket or web server.

## Why Choose Drive Boost

<Info>
  Drive Boost adds persistent storage to an existing VPS without switching plans
  or reinstalling the OS. Each boost is billed monthly alongside your VPS
  subscription and remains active until you downgrade or cancel it.
</Info>

- Stackable increments: **+10 GB**, **+25 GB**, **+50 GB**, or **+100 GB**  
- Starts at **€3.60/month** for the +10 GB tier  
- Combines cleanly with plan upgrades if you later need more CPU or RAM

<Callout type="tip">
  Need several hundred gigabytes? Order more than one Drive Boost—each block is
  applied to the same virtual disk so you still manage a single volume in the OS.

## Finish the Expansion Inside Your OS

1. **Confirm the new size** with `lsblk`, `fdisk -l`, or the Windows Disk Management console.  
2. **Extend the partition** (e.g., `growpart`, `parted`, or DiskPart).  
3. **Grow the filesystem** using the appropriate tool (`resize2fs`, `xfs_growfs`, etc.).  
4. Validate that the mount point now shows the expanded capacity.

<Callout type="warning">
  <strong>EDBB never edits guest partitions for you.</strong> Drive Boost enlarges
  the virtual disk only—the OS keeps its original partition layout until you
  extend it manually. Back up critical data, grow partitions with your preferred
  tools, and reboot if the kernel still reports the old size.
</Callout>

Need to extend other resources at the same time? Combine Drive Boost with RAM,
vCPU, or IPv4 upgrades in the same workflow.

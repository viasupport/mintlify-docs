## Available Drive Boosts

Extend your VPS storage in 10 GB to 100 GB increments.  
Pricing starts at €3.60 per month for +10 GB and scales with larger additions.

## How to Request

1. Send Support the VPS IP or KVM ID.  
2. Specify the additional capacity you need.  
3. We issue an invoice; once paid, the extra disk is attached.  
4. Expand the partition and filesystem inside the OS when you’re ready—EDBB won’t modify your partitions automatically.

For larger extensions, multiple 100 GB blocks can be stacked as required.

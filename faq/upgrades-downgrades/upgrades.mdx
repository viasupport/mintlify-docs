## Choose the Right Upgrade Strategy

<Info>
  EDBB offers two flexible upgrade paths: jump to a larger VPS plan in one click, or bolt on extra resources without changing tiers. Both options are prorated and complete without reinstalling your OS.

<Note>
  Downgrades aren’t available at the moment. If you’re experimenting with larger plans, capture snapshots or backups before upgrading so you can redeploy on a smaller instance later if needed.

## Why Downgrades Are Disabled

<Info>
  Shrinking a virtual disk is just as risky as shrinking a physical drive—partitions must be resized perfectly or data can be lost. To avoid accidental corruption, EDBB only allows upgrades.
</Info>

- VPS storage is provisioned at the plan’s full size.  
- Lowering disk size mid-flight doesn’t guarantee consistency.  
- Other resources (CPU/RAM) are tied to the plan profile, so rolling back would require reprovisioning anyway.

## Safe Path to a Smaller Footprint

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deploy the new plan">
    Order the smaller VPS tier alongside your current service.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Migrate workloads">
    Move data using backups, rsync, snapshots, or application-level exports. Test the new instance thoroughly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retire the original VPS">
    Once satisfied, cancel the old service. This avoids disk resizing risks and keeps downtime minimal.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Keep routine backups (or qcow2 exports) so you can revert quickly if the smaller plan doesn’t meet expectations.

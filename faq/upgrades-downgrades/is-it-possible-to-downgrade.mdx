## Why Downgrades Aren’t Supported

KVM VPS disks behave like physical drives.  
Shrinking a virtual disk risks data loss, so EDBB only supports plan upgrades.

## Recommended Approach

1. Order the smaller plan you want.  
2. Migrate applications and data manually.  
3. Cancel the original VPS once migration is complete.

Always maintain current backups before making plan changes.

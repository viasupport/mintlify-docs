# Upgrade a VPS Plan in Minutes

<Info>
  Plan upgrades swap your current VPS for a larger predefined tier—more vCPU, RAM, disk, and monthly traffic—without reinstalling or changing the IP address.
</Info>

## Why Upgrade

- Add CPU, memory, and disk space in one step.  
- Boost the monthly traffic allowance tied to the plan.  
- Keep your data intact; the upgrade happens in-place.

<Callout type="info">
  Upgrades are prorated. You pay only the price difference for the remaining days in your billing cycle.
</Callout>

## Option 1 — Use the Quick Upgrade Card

If you already know which tier you need, click the upgrade shortcut on the service Control Panel.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the VPS dashboard">
    Sign in to the <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank">EDBB Control Panel</a> and choose the service you want to scale.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Press Upgrade">
    Hit the green <strong>Upgrade</strong> button in the right-hand column. You’ll land on the plan comparison page that lists every tier above your current one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a plan and pay">
    Pick the higher plan, review the prorated amount, and pay the invoice. Once the payment clears, the upgrade finalises automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Option 2 — Order from the Upgrade Tab

Need to compare plan details first? Use the dedicated Upgrade tab.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Upgrade tab">
    In the service view, click <strong>Upgrade</strong> in the tabs bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Upgrade Plan">
    Press the blue <strong>Upgrade Plan</strong> button. This loads the comparison page that lists each higher tier with resource details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and checkout">
    Compare CPU, RAM, storage, and traffic quotas. Select your target plan, pay the prorated invoice, and the Control Panel handles the rest.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Upgrades trigger a short reboot so the new resources can load. Save work inside the OS before confirming the change.
</Callout>

## After the Upgrade

- **IP & data** stay the same—no migration is required.  
- **RAM & vCPU** are available after a cold reboot of the VPS.  
- **Disk size** increases, but filesystems and partitions are untouched; expand them manually if you want to use the extra space.  
- **Traffic allowance** increases immediately.

Need granular resource changes instead? Use Upgrade Components.

## Need Even More Traffic

Top up your traffic pool to share data transfer across services. Auto-hydration can refill VPS traffic automatically when it nears 99% usage.

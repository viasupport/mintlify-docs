## 🚀 How to upgrade your VPS to a higher tier

You can upgrade your VPS plan (e.g. from **KVM SMART** to **KVM STARTER**) anytime directly through the management portal.

## 🔄 What is a VPS Plan Upgrade?

A plan upgrade means moving your VPS to a **larger, predefined plan** with more resources like:
- More RAM
- More vCPU cores
- More traffic commitment

No need to reinstall or migrate! The upgrade happens in-place.



---

## 💶 How is it billed?

You only pay the **price difference** between the two plans, **prorated for the rest of the billing period**.  
You don’t pay the full price of the new plan — just the upgrade difference (you don't pay twice)

---

## 🛠️ How to order a Plan Upgrade

3. Click the **“Upgrade”** button
4. Select the higher plan, confirm, and pay the invoice

- **Disk remains untouched** – you choose whether to resize your filesystem

## Need more traffic than our plans offer?

If you are already on the largest tier and need more traffic, you can purchase additional pool capacity. EDBB traffic pools let you manually assign traffic to any VPS or enable auto-hydration at 99% usage.

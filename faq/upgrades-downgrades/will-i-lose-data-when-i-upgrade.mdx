## What Changes During an Upgrade

- Additional vCPUs, RAM, and monthly traffic allowance are provisioned  
- The virtual disk size increases, but existing partitions are left untouched

## Data Safety

EDBB does not automatically resize or format your filesystem.  
Your data remains in place; you can expand partitions manually after the upgrade or leave them as-is.

Only a full reinstall wipes the disk. Continue running regular backups to protect against accidental loss.

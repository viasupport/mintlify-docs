## Upgrade Impact at a Glance

<Info>
  Plan upgrades add CPU, RAM, storage capacity, and traffic allowance—but they do <strong>not</strong> reimage your VPS. Existing partitions remain exactly as they were before the upgrade.
</Info>

| Resource | What the upgrade does | What it doesn’t do |
|----------|----------------------|--------------------|
| vCPU / RAM | Hot-adds the new allocation (reboot may be advised for the guest OS to detect it) | Doesn’t wipe memory disks or reset configs |
| Disk size | Expands the virtual disk capacity | Doesn’t resize partitions or filesystems automatically |
| Traffic allowance | Boosts monthly quota | Doesn’t reset usage mid-cycle |

## Keeping Data Safe

- Filesystems remain untouched; extend partitions with your preferred tool (`growpart`, `lsblk`, Disk Management) if you want to use the new space.  
- Snapshots and qcow2 exports stay available after the upgrade.  
- Only a reinstall or manual destructive action removes data—plan normal backups as you would for any production system.

<Note>
  Best practice: take a backup before major changes. Upgrades are non-destructive, but backups protect against unrelated user mistakes or software issues during post-upgrade tuning.

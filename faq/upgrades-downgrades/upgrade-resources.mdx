## 🧩 Upgrade VPS Resources (RAM, CPU, Disk, IPs)

Need more resources without changing your entire plan?  
You can add more **RAM, vCPU cores, disk space (Drive Boost)** or **IP addresses** to your VPS.

---

## 🆚 What's the difference?

This is **not** a plan change. It's a **resource extension** of your current VPS.

You can:
- Add **more RAM**
- Add **more vCPU cores**
- Boost your **disk space** (Drive Boost)
- Add **IPv4 addresses**
- Mix and match any of the above

---

## 💶 How is it billed?

Just like plan upgrades:  
You only pay the **prorated amount** for the rest of your billing cycle.

## Need more traffic than our plans offer?

If you are already on the largest tier and need more traffic, you can purchase additional pool capacity. EDBB traffic pools let you manually assign traffic to your VPS or enable auto-hydration at 99% usage.

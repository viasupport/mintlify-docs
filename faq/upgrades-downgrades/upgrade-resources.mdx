# Upgrade VPS Components

<Info>
  Component upgrades extend the resources of your current plan—RAM, vCPU, Drive Boost storage, or IPv4 addresses—without changing tiers or reinstalling the OS.
</Info>

## What You Can Extend

- Increase **RAM** for memory-intensive workloads.  
- Add extra **vCPU** cores for parallel processing.  
- Apply a **Drive Boost** to unlock additional disk space.  
- Assign additional **IPv4 addresses**.  
- Mix and match any combination of the above.

<Callout type="info">
  Billing is prorated just like plan upgrades—you pay only the difference for the days remaining in your billing cycle.
</Callout>

## Order a Component Upgrade via the Control Panel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the VPS dashboard">
    Sign in at the <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank">EDBB Control Panel</a>, go to <strong>Services</strong>, and choose the VPS you want to extend.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Upgrade → Upgrade Components">
    Click the <strong>Upgrade</strong> tab, then press the blue <strong>Upgrade Components</strong> button. The comparison page lists each resource you can increase.
    <div style={{marginTop: "16px"}}>
      <img src="/assets/Upgrade-components.png" alt="Upgrade Components selection" style={{width: "100%", maxWidth: "820px", borderRadius: "16px", border: "1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.08)"}} />
    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select resources & checkout">
    Choose the additional RAM, vCPU, disk, or IPv4 addresses you need, pay the prorated invoice, and the changes apply automatically once payment clears.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Component upgrades may trigger a short reboot so the new resources take effect. Save your work before confirming the order.
</Callout>

## After Payment

- Upgrades are processed within minutes after payment confirmation.  
- Expect an email summarising the change.  
- **RAM & vCPU** require a cold reboot inside the OS.  
- **IPv4 addresses** must be configured manually on the VPS.  
- **Drive Boost** expands the virtual disk, but you decide when to grow partitions or filesystems.

Need a full plan change instead? See the higher-tier upgrade guide.

## Need More Traffic

Consider the traffic pool to top up bandwidth for any VPS in your account. Auto hydration can refill traffic automatically near 99% usage.

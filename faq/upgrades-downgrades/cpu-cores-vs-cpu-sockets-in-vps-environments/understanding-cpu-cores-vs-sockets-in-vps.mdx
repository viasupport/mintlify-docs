## Definitions

- **Core** – individual processing unit within a CPU.  
- **Socket** – physical CPU slot; each socket may host multiple cores.

In virtualization, a vCPU can be presented as multiple cores on a single socket or split across virtual sockets to satisfy guest OS limits.

## Why Presentation Matters

- Windows editions typically recognize up to two sockets but many cores per socket.  
- Some licensing models count sockets instead of cores.  
- Certain software may perform better when cores are exposed as a single socket.

## Adjusting in the Portal

1. Open the VPS in the EDBB portal.  
2. Go to **KVM Settings** → **CPU Topology**.  
3. Select the desired combination of sockets and cores.  
4. Shut down the VPS, apply the change, and power it back on.

Choose the topology that matches your operating system and licensing requirements for optimal behavior.

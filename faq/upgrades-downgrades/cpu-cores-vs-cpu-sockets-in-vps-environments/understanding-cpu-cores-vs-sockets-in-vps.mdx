## Core vs Socket Basics

<Info>
  In KVM virtualization, each vCPU can be exposed as a “core” on a virtual socket. You decide whether to pack all cores into one socket or spread them across multiple sockets, depending on OS and licensing requirements.
</Info>

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Core** | The individual processing unit within a CPU. |
| **Socket** | The physical (or virtual) CPU package; can host multiple cores. |
| **vCPU** | A virtual CPU presented to the guest OS—mapped to cores/sockets based on your topology. |

## Why the Topology Matters

- **Operating system limits** – Many Windows editions recognize only two sockets but support dozens of cores per socket. Linux is generally flexible.  
- **Licensing models** – Some software counts sockets (SQL Server Standard, certain hypervisor licenses) while others count cores.  
- **NUMA-aware workloads** – Apps optimized for multi-socket systems may benefit from spreading cores across sockets, while cache-sensitive workloads often prefer a single socket packed with cores.

## Change the CPU Topology in the Portal

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open CPU settings">
    In the EDBB VPS Portal, go to <strong>Settings → System Configuration</strong> (or **KVM Settings**), then locate <strong>CPU Topology</strong>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose sockets & cores">
    Select how many sockets and how many cores per socket you want. The total cores × sockets must equal your vCPU allocation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply cleanly">
    Shut down the VPS, apply the change, and power the machine back on so the guest OS detects the new layout.
  </Step>
</Steps>

> Tip: Before adjusting topology, confirm your OS and application licensing terms to avoid unintended compliance issues.

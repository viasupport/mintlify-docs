## Does EDBB filter or block any ports?

**EDBB doesn't block or filter customer ports.** Public IPs route directly to your VPS, so you decide which services to run and which firewall rules to enforce.

<Note>
  Please respect the **no-spam policy**. Verified abuse reports may lead to service termination without refund.

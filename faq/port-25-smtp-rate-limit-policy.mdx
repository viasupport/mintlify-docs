## Outbound SMTP Availability

EDBB leaves **TCP port 25 open** for customers who run their own mail infrastructure.  
To prevent abuse and maintain deliverability, outbound traffic is rate-limited to **8 packets per second** with an **initial burst of 16 pps**.

This policy strikes a balance between legitimate transactional email and the need to protect shared IP ranges from spam activity.

## Why the Limit Exists

- **IP reputation protection** – throttling reduces the risk of our ranges appearing on blocklists used by Gmail, Outlook, and other providers.  
- **Fair usage** – ensures one tenant cannot monopolize outbound SMTP bandwidth.  
- **Abuse deterrence** – makes the platform less attractive for spammers while keeping it practical for real businesses.  
- **Consistent policy** – the same rules apply to every VPS created after 24 February 2025, regardless of payment method.

## Impact on Your Mail Flow

- Regular business email, admin alerts, or transactional workloads are unaffected.  
- Bulk mailing or newsletter campaigns should use specialized providers (SendGrid, Mailgun, Amazon SES, etc.).  
- The limit cannot be lifted or customized per account.

Remember that EDBB enforces a strict **no-spam policy**. Verified spam reports may lead to immediate suspension without refund.

## Recommendations

1. Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to improve inbox placement.  
2. Monitor mail queues and bounce rates—most issues originate from application misconfiguration rather than the rate limit.  
3. For high-volume campaigns, integrate with a dedicated SMTP relay service.  
4. Keep abuse contacts up to date in WHOIS/RDAP so you can address complaints quickly.

If you have specific compliance questions, open a ticket with EDBB Support before deploying a new mail workload.

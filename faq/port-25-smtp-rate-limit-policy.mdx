# Outbound SMTP Policy

<Info>
  EDBB keeps TCP port 25 open so you can run your own mail services. To protect shared IP reputation, outbound traffic is rate-limited to <strong>8 packets per second</strong> with an initial burst of 16 pps.

## Why We Rate-Limit Port 25

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="🛡️ IP Reputation">
    Throttling prevents sudden spam bursts that could land shared IP ranges on blocklists.
  </Card>
  <Card title="⚖️ Fair Usage">
    Keeps one VPS from monopolizing outbound SMTP bandwidth.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🚫 Abuse Deterrence">
    Makes the platform less attractive for spammers while staying practical for legitimate email.
  </Card>
  <Card title="📅 Consistent Policy">
    Applies to every VPS created after 24 February 2025. The limit is not adjustable per account.

## What This Means for You

- Transactional email, server alerts, and admin notifications operate normally.  
- Bulk campaigns or newsletters should use dedicated providers (SendGrid, Mailgun, Amazon SES, etc.).  
- Exceeding the limit will slow delivery but won’t block single messages outright.  
- EDBB enforces a strict no-spam policy—verified abuse leads to suspension without refund.

## Best Practices

1. Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to improve deliverability.  
2. Monitor mail queues and bounce reports; most issues stem from application misconfiguration rather than the rate limit.  
3. Keep abuse contacts current in WHOIS/RDAP so you can respond quickly to complaints.  
4. For high-volume sending, integrate with a reputable SMTP relay service.

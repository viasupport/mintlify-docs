## Where GeoIP Data Comes From

<Info>
  Geo-location services combine registry data, geofeed files, and crowd-sourced updates. EDBB publishes accurate records to each Regional Internet Registry (RIR) and maintains geofeeds so providers know where our prefixes live.
</Info>

- RIR WHOIS listings include our organization details, country codes, and abuse contacts. Check the prefix in <a href="https://stat.ripe.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RIPEstat</a>, <a href="https://whois.arin.net/ui/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ARIN</a>, <a href="https://rdap.apnic.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">APNIC</a>, <a href="https://rdap.lacnic.net/rdap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">LACNIC</a>, or <a href="https://rdap.afrinic.net/rdap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">AFRINIC</a> depending on the allocation.  
- Geofeed files supply latitude/longitude hints for automated platforms—see the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RFC 8805 geofeed format</a> for details.  
- Some vendors accept corrections directly from users (for example, <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/location-feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">WhatIsMyIPAddress feedback</a> or <a href="https://db-ip.com/report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DB-IP reports</a>), which can temporarily override authoritative data.

## Why Lookup Results Sometimes Differ

- Each provider refreshes on its own cadence (from daily to monthly).  
- User-submitted overrides or stale caches can surface outdated city/country mappings.  
- New deployments may take a refresh cycle or two before every dataset aligns.

If you spot incorrect results, reach out to the GeoIP service with the correct WHOIS and geofeed reference. Most vendors re-sync within their next batch update; common contact points include <a href="https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407111580443-Correct-a-Location" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MaxMind GeoIP corrections</a>, <a href="https://ipinfo.io/account/data-corrections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IPinfo data corrections</a>, and the <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/location-feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">WhatIsMyIPAddress feedback form</a>.

## Verifying Your Address

- Run a WHOIS lookup on the prefix to view the authoritative country and organization fields—<a href="https://stat.ripe.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RIPEstat</a> and <a href="https://whois.arin.net/ui/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ARIN WHOIS</a> are good starting points.  
- Compare several GeoIP databases (e.g., <a href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MaxMind demo</a>, <a href="https://ipinfo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ipinfo.io</a>, <a href="https://db-ip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DB-IP</a>). If only one disagrees, it likely needs to refresh.  
- Contact EDBB Support if you require assistance nudging a particular provider.

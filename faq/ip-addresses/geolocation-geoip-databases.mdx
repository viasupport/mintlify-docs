## Source of GeoIP Data

Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) such as RIPE, ARIN, APNIC, LACNIC, and AFRINIC maintain authoritative records for each IPv4/IPv6 allocation.  \n+WHOIS entries contain country codes, abuse contacts, and optional geolocation metadata.  \n+EDBB submits accurate details for every prefix we announce.

Many GeoIP providers also consume **geofeed** files that network operators publish.  \n+EDBB maintains geofeed entries so downstream services can map our addresses to the correct latitude/longitude.

## Why Lookup Results Sometimes Differ

- Providers refresh at different intervals—some daily, others weekly or longer.  \n
- Certain platforms let end users override location data, which can introduce temporary errors.  \n
- Cached datasets may lag behind recent moves or new deployments.

If you spot an outdated location in a third-party app, contact their support to request a database refresh using the current registry and geofeed information.

## Verifying Your Address

- Check the WHOIS output for the prefix to confirm the registered location.  \n
- Compare multiple GeoIP services to determine whether a single provider is out of sync.  \n
- Raise a ticket with EDBB Support if you need assistance liaising with a specific lookup vendor.

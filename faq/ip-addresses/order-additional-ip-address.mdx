## How to Place the Order

1. Contact EDBB Support via the messenger in the customer portal.  
2. Provide the VPS identifier (primary IPv4 or KVM ID).  
3. Specify how many additional addresses you require (maximum 10).

You’ll receive a payment link for the add-on. After payment clears, the new IPv4 address is provisioned automatically and appears in the VPS management view.

Remember to configure the interface within your operating system so the additional address becomes reachable.

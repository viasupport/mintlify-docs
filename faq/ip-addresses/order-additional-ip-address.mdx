## How to Place the Order

### Option A: Chat with Support

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the conversation">
    Sign in to the EDBB Control Panel and contact Support via the messenger or by email—let them know you’d like more IPv4 addresses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share the service details">
    Provide the primary IPv4 (or KVM service ID) and state how many extra addresses you need—up to ten per VPS.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve the invoice">
    Support sends a payment link for the add-on. Once it’s paid, the new IPv4 addresses appear under the <strong>Network</strong> tab of the service.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option B: Order via Upgrade Components

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Upgrades for the VPS">
    From <strong>Services</strong>, pick the VPS and switch to the <strong>Upgrades</strong> tab. Choose <strong>Upgrade Components</strong>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Additional IPs">
    Enter the number of addresses you want (up to ten) and proceed to checkout.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pay and confirm">
    Complete the payment. The new IPv4 assignments populate automatically under the <strong>Network</strong> tab.
  </Step>
</Steps>

After either option, configure each IP inside your operating system (netplan, NetworkManager, or Windows TCP/IP settings) so traffic starts flowing—or reinstall the VPS to let the new addresses apply automatically.

## Verify the Scope of the Issue

1. Check connectivity from a different network (mobile hotspot, secondary ISP, VPN) to confirm whether the block is specific to your local provider.  \n
2. Use remote monitoring nodes or colleagues in other countries to ping the IP.  \n
3. If the address works elsewhere but not from your country, the path is likely filtered by a regional carrier or regulator.

## Request a Replacement IP

Within the first 24 hours of provisioning, EDBB will swap the primary IPv4 free of charge.  \n+Open a ticket, mention the VPS identifier, and include test results showing the failure.  \n+After the change, reinstall or configure the new address manually so services come back online.

## Mitigation Tips

- Avoid reusing blocked IP information in DNS or application settings.  \n
- Where applicable, configure regional CDN or proxy services to absorb country-level filtering.  \n
- For long-term resilience, maintain standby nodes in alternate jurisdictions.

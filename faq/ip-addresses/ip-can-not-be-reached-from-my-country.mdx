## First Confirm the Scope

<Info>
  Regional carriers or national firewalls sometimes filter specific IPv4 ranges. Before requesting changes, confirm whether the problem only affects your local network or if it is widespread.
</Info>

## Verify the Scope of the Issue

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test from alternate networks">
    Try a mobile hotspot, a second ISP, or a trusted VPN. If those succeed, the block likely sits with your primary provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check from other regions">
    Ask colleagues abroad or use external monitors (Looking Glass, latency tools) to ping the IP from multiple countries.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document your findings">
    Capture traceroute/WinMTR output and note timestamps. This evidence speeds up any follow-up with EDBB or upstream carriers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Request a Replacement IP

Within the first 24 hours of provisioning, EDBB will swap the primary IPv4 once at no cost.

- Contact Support via the messenger or email with your VPS identifier.  
- Attach the reachability tests showing where the IP is blocked.  
- Once approved, the portal replaces the address—reinstall the VPS or apply the new configuration manually so services resume.

## Mitigation Tips

- Update DNS records and application allow-lists with the replacement IP promptly.  
- Where available, leverage a CDN or proxy with PoPs in your target region to absorb filtering.  
- Maintain standby nodes in alternate jurisdictions as part of your continuity plan.

## Static by Default

<Info>
  Every EDBB VPS ships with one dedicated IPv4 and a /64 IPv6 subnet. They are yours for the lifetime of the service.
</Info>

- The assignments persist through reboots, reinstalls, and plan upgrades.  
- They only change if you cancel, trigger the 24-hour complimentary swap, or order a paid IP change.  
- Additional IPv4s can be layered on via Support or the Upgrade Components flow without affecting the primary IP.

## Why the Location Looks Wrong

GeoIP services use aggregated databases that may lag behind registry updates.  \n+If a provider has not refreshed its dataset since EDBB deployed your VPS, the lookup can point to a previous city or country.

## Steps to Verify

1. Compare results across several GeoIP tools to determine whether the issue is isolated to one provider.  \n
2. Check the WHOIS output for the subnet to confirm the registered location.  \n
3. Review the [GeoIP database overview](./geolocation-geoip-databases) for more context on how data propagates.

## Requesting a Fix

When opening a ticket with EDBB Support, include:  \n
- VPS identifier (primary IPv4 or KVM ID)  \n
- The GeoIP service showing the wrong data  \n
- Screenshot or link to the incorrect lookup

We will confirm that our registry and geofeed entries are accurate and, if necessary, contact the provider or advise you on how to submit a correction request directly.

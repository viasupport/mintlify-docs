## Why WhatIsMyIPAddress Shows the Wrong City

<Info>
  WhatIsMyIPAddress.com aggregates data from commercial GeoIP feeds. If those feeds have not refreshed since EDBB updated its registry and geofeed records, your address may still point to an old city or country.
</Info>

- Registry entries (WHOIS) and geofeed files are authoritative, but each provider decides when to ingest them.  
- Some lookups crowdsource corrections; an inaccurate user submission can temporarily override the official data.  
- CDN caches can serve stale results until their refresh cycle completes.

## Confirm the Actual Location

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the authoritative data">
    Run a WHOIS lookup on the prefix (for example, via <a href="https://www.ripe.net/ripe-db/support/querying-the-ripe-database" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RIPEstat</a>). Confirm the country code and organization match EDBB.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compare other databases">
    Test a few GeoIP services (MaxMind checker, ipinfo.io, DB-IP). If only WhatIsMyIPAddress disagrees, the issue is localised to their feed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect evidence">
    Take a screenshot of the incorrect result and note the date/time. This helps both EDBB Support and third-party providers verify the discrepancy quickly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Submit a Correction to WhatIsMyIPAddress

WhatIsMyIPAddress offers a public correction form. Fill it out with the authoritative data:

1. Visit <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/location-feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">their location feedback page</a>.  
2. Enter the IP address, choose the correct country/region, and paste the WHOIS evidence or geofeed link.  
3. Mention that EDBB has already published the updated information via the relevant RIR.  
4. Submit the form and keep the confirmation email for your records.

They typically process requests within a few business days, depending on their data provider’s update cycle.

## When to Contact EDBB Support

If the listing remains incorrect after you file the correction—or if multiple providers disagree—reach out to EDBB Support with:

- Your VPS identifier (primary IPv4 or KVM ID)  
- Links or screenshots of each lookup result  
- The correction request reference number (if you received one)

Our team will double-check registry/geofeed records and liaise with the data vendor if needed.

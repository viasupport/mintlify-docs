description: "EDBB enforces source validation across its network. IP spoofing is prohibited and blocked at the edge."

## Policy

EDBB does not permit IP spoofing on any service.  
Edge filters enforce source validation so packets with forged addresses are discarded before they leave the network.

## Rationale

- Protects the EDBB backbone and upstream partners from abuse
- Maintains reputation for shared IP ranges
- Complies with anti-spoofing best practices (BCP 38/84)

Accounts found attempting to circumvent these controls risk immediate termination without refund.

description: "EDBB enforces source validation across its network. IP spoofing is prohibited and blocked at the edge."

## Policy

<Info>
  EDBB enforces source validation (BCP 38/84) across all platforms. Packets must leave the network with the IPs that belong to your service.
</Info>

IP spoofing is blocked on every VPS and dedicated server. Edge filters drop traffic with forged source addresses before it reaches upstream carriers.

## Rationale

- Protects the EDBB backbone and upstream partners from abuse
- Maintains reputation for shared IP ranges
- Complies with anti-spoofing best practices (BCP 38/84)

Accounts found attempting to circumvent these controls risk immediate termination without refund.

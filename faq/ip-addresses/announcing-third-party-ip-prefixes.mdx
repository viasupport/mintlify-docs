## Can VPS Plans Announce Customer Prefixes?

<Info>
  VPS offerings use EDBB-owned IP space. Customer-owned prefixes require BGP capabilities that aren’t exposed on shared virtualization platforms.
</Info>

If you need to announce your own IPv4/IPv6 blocks, plan a move to an EDBB dedicated server.

## Dedicated Server Requirements

- One-time non-recurring charge (NRC) for the BGP setup: **USD 250**.  
- No ongoing fee once the announcement is active.  
- Prefix must comply with EDBB’s policies (for example, no unsolicited email).  
- You must provide your ASN, a current LOA, and routing details.

Submit the documentation via Support to schedule the announcement window.

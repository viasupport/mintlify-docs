## What a DNS Leak Test Really Shows

<Info>
  DNS leak tools report the location of the **resolver** that handled your query, not the location of your VPS. EDBB ships anycast resolvers, so the nearest point of presence may live in a neighboring country.
</Info>

When you run a test, expect to see the city of the resolver PoP that answered. The VPS itself still resides in the data center you selected.

## Does This Change Geo-IP Results?

No—Geo-IP lookups track the public IPv4/IPv6 assigned to your VPS. Switching resolvers has no impact on how websites geolocate your service.

## Prefer a Different Resolver?

Updating the resolver is optional, but easy:

- Linux: adjust `/etc/resolv.conf`, netplan, or NetworkManager to use your chosen DNS servers.  
- Windows: open the adapter properties → **Internet Protocol Version 4/6** → specify custom DNS servers.  
- Custom resolvers (Unbound, Pi-hole, etc.) can be hosted on the VPS or elsewhere if you need total control.

## Why Run DNS Leak Tests at All?

- Verify VPN tunnels keep DNS traffic inside the encrypted path.  
- Confirm the system isn’t falling back to an ISP resolver.  
- Understand which organizations see your DNS requests.

Use the results to validate that your resolver configuration matches your privacy and compliance goals.

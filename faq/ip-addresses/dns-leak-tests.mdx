## Why Leak Tests Show Other Countries

EDBB VPS images ship with anycast resolvers.  \n+When you run a DNS leak test, the tool reports the location of the resolver that answered—not the VPS itself.  \n+Because anycast routes each query to the closest available PoP, the resolver can sit in a neighboring country even though the VPS remains in its original data center.

## Does This Affect Geo-IP?

No. Geo-location checks rely on the VPS public IPv4/IPv6, not on the DNS resolver.  \n+Changing resolvers has no impact on where services perceive the VPS to be hosted.

## Changing Resolvers (Optional)

If you want tests to reference a specific DNS service, update `/etc/resolv.conf` or your OS network configuration to point at your preferred resolvers.  \n+Common choices include public resolvers or custom DNS servers you operate yourself.

## Purpose of a DNS Leak Test

- Confirms requests stay inside a secure tunnel (e.g., VPN).  \n
- Highlights unintended fallback to local ISP resolvers.  \n
- Provides transparency about which organizations handle your DNS lookups.

Use the results to validate that the resolvers configured on your VPS match your privacy or compliance needs.

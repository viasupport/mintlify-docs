## Before You Start

<Info>
  Collect hop-by-hop data as soon as you observe loss or latency. Fresh diagnostics help EDBB identify whether the issue sits with your ISP, an upstream carrier, or inside the data center.
</Info>

## Windows Tools

### Command Prompt Traceroute

1. Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, and hit **Enter**.  
2. Run `tracert <VPS IPv4 or IPv6>`.  
3. After it completes, right-click the title bar → **Edit → Mark**, select the entire output, press **Enter**, and paste it into your support message (messenger or email).

### WinMTR (Recommended for trending loss)

1. Download and install WinMTR.  
2. Launch the app and enter the VPS IPv4 in **Host**.  
3. Click **Start** and let it run for 5–10 minutes.  
4. Use **Export TEXT** to save the results and attach the file.

## Linux or macOS

1. Install the tools if needed:  
   - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install traceroute mtr`  
   - RHEL/CentOS/Alma/Rocky: `sudo dnf install traceroute mtr`
2. Run `traceroute <VPS IPv4>` to capture the hop list.  
3. Run `mtr -w -c 100 <VPS IPv4>` for a summary, or `mtr -rwzbc 100 <VPS IPv4> > mtr-report.txt` to export a text file.  
4. Attach the output or saved file when contacting Support via messenger or email.

> For IPv6, repeat the commands with `traceroute6` / `mtr -6`.

## Submitting the Results

Include the traceroute/WinMTR/MTR output, the time of the test, and the VPS IP in your support message.  
EDBB engineers use this hop-by-hop data to determine whether the issue is on your local network, an upstream carrier, or within the data center.

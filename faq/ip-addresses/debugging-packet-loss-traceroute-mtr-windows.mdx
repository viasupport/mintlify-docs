## When to Capture Diagnostics

If you notice packet loss or unusual latency, share traceroute or MTR/WinMTR results with EDBB support.  
These reports reveal where along the path traffic is delayed or dropped.

## Windows: Built-in Traceroute

1. Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, and press **Enter**.  
2. Run `tracert <VPS IPv4>`.  
3. Wait for the trace to finish.  
4. Right-click the window title → **Edit** → **Mark**, highlight the full output, press **Enter**, then paste it into your ticket.

## Windows: WinMTR

1. Download and install WinMTR.  
2. Launch the app and enter the VPS IPv4 in **Host**.  
3. Click **Start** and let it run for 5–10 minutes.  
4. Use **Export TEXT** to save the results and attach the file.

## Linux (and macOS): traceroute & mtr

1. Install the tools if needed:  
   - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install traceroute mtr`  
   - RHEL/CentOS/Alma/Rocky: `sudo dnf install traceroute mtr`
2. Run `traceroute <VPS IPv4>` to capture the hop list.  
3. Run `mtr -w -c 100 <VPS IPv4>` for a summary, or `mtr -rwzbc 100 <VPS IPv4> > mtr-report.txt` to export a text file.  
4. Attach the output or saved file when contacting support.

## Submitting the Results

Include the traceroute/WinMTR/MTR output, the time of the test, and the VPS IP in your ticket.  
EDBB engineers use this hop-by-hop data to determine whether the issue is on your local network, an upstream carrier, or within the data center.

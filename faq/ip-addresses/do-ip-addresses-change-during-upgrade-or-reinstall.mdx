## What Happens to Your IPs?

<Info>
  Reinstalling the operating system or changing your VPS plan does <strong>not</strong> rotate the assigned IPv4 or IPv6. The addresses stay linked to the service for as long as it remains active.

### The Exceptions

- Cancelling or letting the VPS expire releases the IPs back into EDBB’s pool.  
- Ordering a free (first 24 hours) or paid IP change assigns a fresh address.  
- Adding secondary IPs appends new addresses but leaves the primary untouched.

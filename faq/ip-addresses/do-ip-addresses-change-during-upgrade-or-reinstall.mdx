## IP Allocation Policy

Reinstalling the operating system or upgrading/downgrading a plan **does not** trigger a new IP assignment.  \n+The IPv4/IPv6 allocated to your VPS remains attached for the life of the service.

Only a voluntary cancellation or an explicit paid IP change will replace the address.

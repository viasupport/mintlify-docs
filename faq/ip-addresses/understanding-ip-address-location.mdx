description: "EDBB assigns IP space per data center. To receive an IP in a different country, deploy the VPS in that region."

## Geographic Binding

IP addresses are allocated in blocks (prefixes) and announced from specific data centers.  \n+Routing policy and registry rules require that a prefix be advertised only from the region where it is physically hosted.

## Practical Outcome

- A VPS in Vienna cannot use an IP from Madrid, and vice versa.  \n
- To obtain an address in another country, provision the VPS or dedicated server in that locale.

Consult the location selector in the EDBB portal to pick the facility that matches your geo-IP and latency requirements.

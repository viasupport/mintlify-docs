## The Limitations and Principles of IP Address Allocation - Why Your Server's Location Matters

It is not possible to assign an IP address from one country to a server in another country.

### The Geographic Link of IP Addresses

IP addresses are arranged in blocks, specifically blocks of 256 addresses known as a /24 network segment (or larger), and these blocks are tied to particular geographic areas and server locations. This structure prevents the assignment of an IP address from one country to a VPS or service in another country, or the rerouting of a single IP address internationally, adhering to the established principles of internet routing.

### Need an IP from Another Country?

If your requirements dictate having an IP address from a different country, the straightforward solution is to purchase a server located in that particular country.

You can discover a broad range of VPS server locations available on our website, offering you the flexibility to choose the IP location that suits your needs.

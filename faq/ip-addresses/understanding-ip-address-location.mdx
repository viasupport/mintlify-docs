## How Location Works

<Info>
  Each EDBB data center advertises its own IP prefixes. Routing policy and registry rules mean those prefixes must be announced from the facility where the hardware lives.

## What This Means for You

- A VPS provisioned in Vienna keeps an Austrian IP. You can’t borrow one from Madrid without moving the workload.  
- Need a different country? Deploy the VPS (or migrate via snapshot) to that region in the EDBB portal.  
- For multi-region presence, run multiple VPSs and dispatch traffic with DNS, load balancing, or tunneling tools.

Consult the location selector in the EDBB portal to pick the facility that matches your geo-IP and latency requirements.

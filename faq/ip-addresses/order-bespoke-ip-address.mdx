## How to Request a Bespoke IPv4

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact EDBB Support">
    From the EDBB VPS Portal, reach out via the messenger or by email. Include your VPS identifier (primary IPv4 or KVM ID) and how many bespoke addresses you need.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Support will reply with the curated list of available addresses for your location. Pick the exact IPv4s you want, confirm the selection, and pay the invoice they send. The chosen addresses appear under the **Network** tab as soon as the order is fulfilled.

Finish by configuring each IPv4 manually within your operating system—or reinstall the VPS so the addresses populate automatically.

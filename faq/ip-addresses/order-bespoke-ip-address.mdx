## Bespoke Address Option

For workloads that need specific ranges, EDBB offers a bespoke add-on.  
You may request up to **10 addresses** and select each one from a curated list available in the target data center.

| Service | Price |
|---------|-------|
| Hand-picked IPv4 | **€10** one-time per address |
| Monthly fee per IPv4 | **€5** |

## Request Workflow

1. Start a conversation with EDBB Support via the portal messenger.  
2. Share the VPS identifier (primary IPv4 or KVM ID) and the count of desired bespoke addresses.  
3. Review the list of available prefixes supplied by the team and select the address(es) you want.

An invoice will be issued. Once payment is recorded, the chosen addresses are assigned to your VPS and visible in the management interface.

As with all additional IPs, configure them manually inside your operating system after assignment.

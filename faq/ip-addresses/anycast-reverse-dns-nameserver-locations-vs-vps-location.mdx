## Why PTR Lookups Show Varied Locations

<Info>
  EDBB operates anycast nameservers. They share identical IPs worldwide, so each query is answered by the closest point of presence (PoP)—that location, not your VPS, is what test tools display.
</Info>

- A UK tester hits a UK PoP.  
- A US tester hits a US PoP.  
- An Asian tester hits the nearest Asian PoP.

Your VPS remains in the data center you chose—only the reply location shifts.

## How EDBB Anycast Works

- Multiple PoPs worldwide advertise the same nameserver IPs.  
- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) steers queries to the closest available PoP.  
- If a PoP goes offline, traffic automatically reroutes to the next closest site.

This design keeps PTR lookups fast and resilient worldwide.

## Key Takeaway

- Reverse DNS location ≠ VPS location.  
- If you need to prove hosting location, provide the VPS IP itself or reference the EDBB portal, not the resolver’s PoP.

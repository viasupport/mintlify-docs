## Why Test Tools Show Different Locations

When a website checks the reverse DNS (PTR) for your VPS IP, the query is answered by the nearest EDBB anycast nameserver.  \n+The result reflects the DNS PoP used, **not** the location of your VPS.

- UK tester → UK nameserver responds  \n
- US tester → US nameserver responds  \n
- Asia tester → Asian nameserver responds

The VPS stays in the data center you selected; only the DNS reply point changes.

## How EDBB Anycast Works

- Dozens of DNS PoPs announce the same nameserver IPs  \n
- Internet routing directs each query to the closest active PoP  \n
- If a PoP goes offline, queries shift automatically to the next nearest site

This design keeps PTR lookups fast and resilient worldwide.

## Key Takeaway

Reverse DNS location ≠ VPS location.  \n+PTR requests follow anycast routing, so expect geographic variance in test outputs even though your VPS remains fixed in its chosen facility.

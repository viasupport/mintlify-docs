## Before You Start

<Info>
  Make sure the forward (A/AAAA) record for your hostname already points to the IP you plan to configure. Reverse PTRs should match the hostname that answers forward lookups to avoid mail reputation issues.

## Update PTR Records in the Portal

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the rDNS tab">
    Sign in to the <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EDBB VPS Portal</a>, pick your VPS from <strong>Services</strong>, and switch to the <strong>rDNS</strong> tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the IPv4 hostname">
    Replace the placeholder with your FQDN, then press <strong>set</strong>. Use <code>unset</code> if you need to remove the record.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add IPv6 entries">
    Enter the desired suffix (for example <code>:1</code>) and hostname, then click <strong>add</strong>. Repeat for additional IPv6 addresses in your /64.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify the Change

EDBB pushes PTR updates instantly, but DNS caching can take a few minutes. Test with an external lookup tool (such as `dig -x`) to confirm the new record.

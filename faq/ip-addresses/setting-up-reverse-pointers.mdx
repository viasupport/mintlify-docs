## Update PTR Records in the Portal

1. Sign in to the [EDBB dashboard](https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php).  \
2. Open **Services** → select the VPS.  \n
3. Choose **Reverse DNS**.  \n
4. Click **Set** to assign a hostname or **Unset** to remove the record.

Changes propagate through EDBB’s anycast DNS within minutes.  \n+Use a DNS lookup tool to confirm the new PTR once caching expires.

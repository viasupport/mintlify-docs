## Prep Checklist

<Info>
  Reverse DNS works best when the hostname already resolves forward to your VPS.
  Create or update the A/AAAA record first so mail servers and reputation
  services see a matching pair.
</Info>

- 📌 Have the exact FQDN you want to publish (for example `mail.example.com`).  
- 🧾 Keep both IPv4 and IPv6 assignments handy—the Network tab lists them.  
- 🔒 Plan to use lowercase hostnames without trailing dots; the portal formats PTRs automatically.

## Update PTR Records in the Portal

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the rDNS panel">
    Sign in to the <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EDBB VPS Portal</a>, select your VPS under <strong>Services</strong>, and choose the <strong>rDNS</strong> tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the primary IPv4 hostname">
    Replace the default value with your hostname and click <strong>Set</strong>. Use <strong>Unset</strong> if you need to revert to the system default.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add IPv6 reverse records">
    For each IPv6 address, enter the suffix (for example <code>:1</code>) and matching hostname, then press <strong>Add</strong>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the summary">
    Confirm the updated entries in the list; edits take effect immediately on EDBB’s side.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify & Troubleshoot

- Use `dig -x <ip>` or an external rDNS checker after a few minutes—public caches may need time to refresh.  
- If the hostname doesn’t appear, double-check that the forward record exists and matches exactly (including subdomain).  
- Still seeing the old PTR? Clear local DNS caches or test from another network.

<Callout type="warning">
  Reverse DNS updates for mail servers should be paired with SPF/DKIM updates.
  Mismatched hostnames can cause outgoing messages to be rejected or flagged as spam.
</Callout>

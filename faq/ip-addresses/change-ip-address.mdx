## Free Change Within 24 Hours

Every new VPS includes a one-time IP change at no cost during the first 24 hours.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the EDBB VPS Portal">
    Sign in to the <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EDBB VPS Portal</a> and pick the VPS from <strong>Services → My Products</strong>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stay on the Dashboard tab">
    The summary card on the right lists <strong>Primary IPv4</strong> with copy and refresh icons. This is where the free swap is triggered.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request the change">
    Click the circular arrows icon beside the IP, confirm the prompt, and the portal will queue the replacement address.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<div style={{marginTop: "16px"}}>
  <img src="/assets/vps-change-ip-recycle-symbol.png" alt="Recycle icon for requesting a free IP change" style={{width: "100%", maxWidth: "420px", borderRadius: "16px", border: "1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.08)"}} />
</div>

<Callout type="info">
  If the refresh icon is greyed out or missing, the complimentary swap has been used—scroll down to the <strong>IP Change</strong> button at the bottom of the page to order a paid change instead.
</Callout>

Once processed, reinstall the VPS or configure the new address manually—the previous IP stops responding immediately.

## Paid Changes After 24 Hours

If the free window has passed, choose one of two add-ons:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="📦 Standard change">
    <p><strong>€5</strong> per request. The portal assigns the next available IPv4—perfect when you just need a fresh address.</p>
    <CtaButton label="Order Standard Change" link="https://my.edbb.com/cart.php?gid=addons" openInNewTab={true} />
  </Card>
  <Card title="🎯 Bespoke change">
    <p><strong>€10</strong> with a curated list of candidates so you can choose the exact IPv4 that fits your compliance or geolocation requirements.</p>
    <CtaButton label="Order Bespoke Change" link="https://my.edbb.com/cart.php?gid=addons" openInNewTab={true} />
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Don’t Forget to Apply the New IP

After the change completes:

- Reinstall the VPS, **or**  
- Configure the new IPv4 through the console or operating system tools.

## Free Change Within 24 Hours

Every new VPS includes a one-time IP change at no cost during the first 24 hours.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the EDBB VPS Portal">
    Sign in to the <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EDBB VPS Portal</a> and pick the VPS from <strong>Services → My Products</strong>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stay on the Dashboard tab">
    The summary card on the right lists <strong>Primary IPv4</strong> with copy and refresh icons. This is where the free swap is triggered.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request the change">
    Click the circular arrows icon beside the IP, confirm the prompt, and the portal will queue the replacement address.
  </Step>
</Steps>

If the refresh icon is greyed out or missing, the complimentary swap has been used—scroll down to the **IP Change** button at the bottom of the page to order a paid change instead.

Once processed, reinstall the VPS or configure the new address manually—the previous IP stops responding immediately.

## Paid Changes After 24 Hours

If the free window has passed, choose one of two add-ons:

| Option | Price | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Standard change | **€5** | Random IPv4 from the available pool |
| Bespoke change | **€10** | Pick an address from a curated list |

### Standard IPv4 Change

The system assigns the next available address automatically. Subnet or prefix cannot be preselected.

### Bespoke IPv4 Change

Review the list of eligible addresses presented after ordering and choose the one that fits your needs.

## Don’t Forget to Apply the New IP

After the change completes:

- Reinstall the VPS, **or**  
- Configure the new IPv4 through the console or operating system tools.

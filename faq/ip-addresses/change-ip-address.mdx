## Free Change Within 24 Hours

Every new VPS includes a one-time IP change at no cost during the first 24 hours.

Steps:

1. Sign in to the [EDBB dashboard](https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php).  
2. Open the VPS under **Services**.  
3. Click the ♻️ icon next to the current IPv4 to request the change.

Once processed, reinstall the VPS or configure the new address manually—the previous IP stops responding immediately.

## Paid Changes After 24 Hours

If the free window has passed, choose one of two add-ons:

| Option | Price | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Standard change | **€5** | Random IPv4 from the available pool |
| Bespoke change | **€10** | Pick an address from a curated list |

### Standard IPv4 Change

The system assigns the next available address automatically. Subnet or prefix cannot be preselected.

### Bespoke IPv4 Change

Review the list of eligible addresses presented after ordering and choose the one that fits your needs.

## Don’t Forget to Apply the New IP

After the change completes:

- Reinstall the VPS, **or**  
- Configure the new IPv4 through the console or operating system tools.

description: "EDBB separates reverse DNS and resolver functions: rDNS runs on our anycast network, forward lookups use Cloudflare resolvers."

## Reverse DNS (PTR)

EDBB hosts PTR records on an in-house anycast platform.  \n+Nameserver IPs are announced from multiple PoPs so reverse lookups stay fast and resilient worldwide.

## Forward DNS (Resolvers)

Default resolvers on EDBB images point to Cloudflare (1.1.1.1 / 1.0.0.1).  \n+Anycast routing sends queries to the nearest available node for low latency and built-in DDoS protection.

## Customizing Settings

You’re free to override resolver choices inside the VPS if you require alternative services or internal DNS.  \n+PTR records, however, remain managed through the EDBB portal to ensure consistency across all allocations.

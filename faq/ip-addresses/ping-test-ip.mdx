## Quick Checks Before You Buy

EDBB publishes several self-service tools so you can evaluate network reachability and make an informed decision about where to deploy.

### Pingable Gateways

- Browse the [gateway directory](https://my.edbb.com/stgfefew_net_list.php) for IPv4 addresses you can ping directly.  
- Availability differs per data center; contact Support if you need confirmation for a specific /24.

### Latency Dashboard

- Visit the experimental [latency app](https://latency.edbb.com) to measure round-trip times from your location to each EDBB site.  
- Results help you shortlist the region with the best response times.

### Looking Glass Catalog

- Use the [Looking Glass index](https://www.edbb.com/blog/looking-glass#list-of-our-worldwide-looking-glass-servers) to run ping, traceroute, and MTR tests from within our network.  
- Download sample files to assess throughput when necessary.

### Location Map

- Explore all VPS points-of-presence on the [interactive map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1OMZyb6w3t_MNEQ-XYb8QlFjwqio&usp=sharing).  
- Each marker links back to the relevant Looking Glass entry or contact details.

Combine the data from these resources to choose the EDBB deployment that matches your latency and routing requirements.

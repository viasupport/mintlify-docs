# Measure Latency Before You Deploy

<Info>
  EDBB offers public tools so you can evaluate round-trip times and routing paths without provisioning a VPS. Combine them to pick the ideal data center for your workload.

## Suggested Workflow

1. **Latency scan** – run the latency app to shortlist the top-performing locations.  
2. **Route verification** – use the Looking Glass to confirm stable paths and evaluate packet loss.  
3. **Gateway pings** – test the on-net gateway for the final candidates to gauge consistency.  
4. **Document results** – save the numbers so you can compare with other providers or regions later.

With these tools, you can make a data-driven decision about where to deploy your EDBB VPS.

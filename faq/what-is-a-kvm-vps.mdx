# Understanding KVM Virtualization

<Info>
  Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) turns the Linux kernel into a type-1 hypervisor. Each VPS runs as an isolated virtual machine with direct access to CPU features, so it behaves much like a dedicated server while retaining cloud flexibility.

## Why KVM Matters at EDBB

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="⚡ Host CPU Passthrough">
    Guests see modern CPU extensions (AES-NI, AVX2, etc.) for encryption and compute-heavy workloads.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🧰 Bring Your Own OS">
    Boot Linux, BSD, or Windows images—or upload custom ISOs and qcow2 snapshots directly in the portal.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🔗 Advanced Networking">
    Create TUN/TAP interfaces, attach additional NICs, or place VPSs on private VLANs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🖥️ Console Access">
    noVNC provides full console control even if SSH or RDP is unreachable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🛡️ Isolation & Security">
    Each VPS gets dedicated resources and hardware-level isolation, reducing noisy neighbor issues.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🔄 Automation Friendly">
    Snapshot, reinstall, or restore with Cloud-Init and API workflows.

## Typical KVM Use Cases

- Network appliances (firewalls, BGP routers, VPN concentrators)
- Security labs and malware analysis sandboxes
- Container platforms and orchestration clusters
- Game and voice servers requiring low latency
- Virtual desktops (Windows or Linux) delivered over RDP/VNC
- Dev/test environments for CI pipelines

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is KVM close to bare metal performance?**  
Yes. With CPU passthrough and Virtio drivers, performance is near-native while disk and network remain virtualized for flexibility.

**Can I install any OS?**  
Upload your ISO or qcow2 image and mount it from the portal. You can also use EDBB’s library of Linux and Windows templates.

**Does it support VPN protocols?**  
Absolutely—TUN/TAP interfaces are available for OpenVPN, WireGuard, IPsec, and other tunneling solutions.

**Can I run hosting control panels?**  
Yes. Plesk, cPanel, DirectAdmin, or any similar stack functions normally on a KVM VPS.

KVM gives you the control of a dedicated server with the convenience of EDBB’s portal and automation tools.

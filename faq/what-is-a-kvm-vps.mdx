## Kernel-based Virtual Machines (KVM)

EDBB VPS instances run on **KVM**, a Linux hypervisor that exposes virtual hardware directly to each guest.  
This approach, often called “full virtualization,” behaves much like a dedicated server while retaining the flexibility of cloud resources.

You can boot Linux, BSD, or Windows images, upload your own ISO, or restore qcow2 backups—all from the EDBB VPS Portal.

## Feature Highlights

- **Host CPU passthrough** – guest systems see modern CPU extensions (AES-NI, AVX2) for high-speed encryption and compute tasks.  
- **TUN/TAP support** – required for VPN servers and advanced tunneling solutions.  
- **Multiple NICs** – attach extra virtual network interfaces for segmentation or routing labs.  
- **VLAN tagging** – enable private layer-2 networks between VPSs in the same facility.  
- **Console access** – troubleshoot with noVNC even if SSH is down.  
- **Bring-your-own-image** – boot custom installers, recovery tools, or tailored qcow2 snapshots.

## Use Cases Beyond Web Hosting

- **Network appliances** – firewalls, BGP routers, or SD-WAN controllers.  
- **Security labs** – penetration testing platforms or malware analysis sandboxes.  
- **Virtual desktop** – deliver Windows or Linux desktops over RDP/VNC.  
- **Container platforms** – run Kubernetes, Nomad, or Docker Swarm with full kernel control.  
- **Telecom workloads** – softswitches, SIP routers, or PBX platforms needing precise networking.  
- **Data processing** – Python, Go, or Rust data pipelines with predictable CPU availability.

## Common Questions

**Is a KVM VPS comparable to bare metal?**  
Yes—each VM gets dedicated resources and direct access to CPU features, while storage and networking remain virtualized for flexibility.

**Can I install my own OS?**  
Upload an ISO/qcow2 through the portal or mount one of EDBB’s library images and launch the installer.

**Does it support VPN protocols?**  
Absolutely. TUN/TAP and dedicated CPU instructions make OpenVPN, WireGuard, and IPsec efficient.

**What about control panels?**  
Plesk, cPanel, DirectAdmin, or any Linux/Windows management stack runs normally on KVM.

### Accidentally Renewed a Service? &#xA;Read how to Convert your Payment to Account Credit

If you’ve accidentally renewed a service but intended to cancel it, follow these steps to request a conversion of your payment to account credit.

1. **Cancel the affected service**:
   Log into your dashboard and cancel the service that was renewed by mistake. This ensures it won’t be auto-renewed again in the future.
2. **Gather the necessary information**:
   You will need to provide the invoice number for the service in question, as well as any associated IP addresses.
3. **Contact the support team**:
   Reach out through the portal messenger or email **support@edbb.com** with the following details:
   - Invoice number
   - Affected IP addresses
   - Reason for your request
4. **Processing Conversion**
   Once our support team reviews your request and confirms the cancellation, your payment will be transferred to your credit balance. You can then use the credit towards future services with us.

<Note>
**The Following Conditions Apply**

The request must be filed before the service’s due date.
The payment must have been made within 24 hours of your request.

Payments are transferred to your account balance, not refunded directly to the original payment method. EDBB reserves the right to decline requests that fall outside these conditions but will always aim for a fair resolution.

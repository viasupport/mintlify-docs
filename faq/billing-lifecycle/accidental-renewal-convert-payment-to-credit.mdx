## Turn an Accidental Renewal into Credit

<Info>
  Mistakenly renewed a VPS you meant to cancel? EDBB can convert the charge into account credit if you act quickly and meet the eligibility checks below.
</Info>

## What to Do

<Steps>
  <Step title="Cancel the renewed service">
    In the portal, request cancellation (immediate) for the VPS that auto-renewed. This prevents additional billing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect the details">
    Note the invoice number, primary IPv4 (or KVM ID), and when the payment was made.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Message Support">
    Contact us via the messenger or email <strong>support@edbb.com</strong> with the information above and confirm you want the payment moved to account credit.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Eligibility Checklist

- Request arrives within **24 hours** of paying the renewal invoice.  
- Service is still within its current billing cycle (not past the due date).  
- No previous courtesy credit for the same service in the last 12 months.  
- Account is in good standing with no AUP violations.

When approved, we transfer the payment to your EDBB account balance. Credits can be used for future invoices but are not refunded to the original payment method.

## What Can Slow Things Down?

- **Payment verification** – crypto transfers waiting on confirmations or card payments flagged for fraud checks.  
- **Out-of-stock configurations** – rare during maintenance windows; we’ll notify you if extra time is needed.  
- **Compliance review** – if we need to verify account information, Support will reach out via messenger or email.

If an order cannot proceed, we arrange a prompt refund or credit so you can choose an alternative plan.

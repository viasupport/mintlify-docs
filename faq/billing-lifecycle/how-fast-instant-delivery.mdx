## Standard Provisioning Timeline

As soon as the invoice is marked paid, an automated provisioning cycle runs.  
- Credit cards: typically within minutes  
- Cryptocurrency: triggered once the required confirmations are reached

## OS Installation Time

- Linux templates complete in roughly **5 minutes**  
- Windows templates need up to **15 minutes** to finish imaging and first boot

You will receive an email with credentials as soon as the VM is ready to access.

## Delays & Compliance Checks

If additional verification is required, EDBB Support will contact you.  
In rare cases where the order cannot proceed, we’ll issue a refund promptly.

## Why Payments Are Blocked

Cryptomus monitors blockchain activity with AML tools.  
If a transfer is flagged, the gateway pauses settlement until the sender provides additional information.

## What to Do

1. Follow the on-screen questionnaire to supply the requested details (source of funds, wallet type, etc.).  
2. Keep your transaction ID (TXID) handy.  
3. If you need direct assistance, contact Cryptomus Support:  
   - Telegram: [@cryptomussupport](https://t.me/cryptomussupport)  
   - Email: [support@cryptomus.com](mailto:support@cryptomus.com)

Support typically operates 06:00–21:00 UTC.  
Once the review is complete, Cryptomus either releases the payment to EDBB or refunds it to your wallet.

## Authorization (Reservation)

When you start a card payment, the processor places an authorization hold.  
- Funds are earmarked on your card but **not** transferred to EDBB yet.  
- Holds expire automatically (typically within 7 days) if the checkout session is interrupted.  
- Because no money changes hands, authorizations cannot be refunded.

## Captured Payment

After a successful checkout, the authorization is captured and the charge posts to your statement.  
- EDBB receives the funds.  
- Refunds are possible; they show up as a separate credit line once processed by your issuer.

If you see a hold without a matching invoice, wait for the authorization to expire or contact your card issuer for details.  
For questions about completed charges, open a ticket with the invoice number and we’ll review the transaction.

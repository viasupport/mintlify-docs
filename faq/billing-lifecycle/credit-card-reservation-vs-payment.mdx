## Authorization (Reservation)

<Info>
  When you begin checkout, Stripe places an authorization hold. It checks the card balance but does not transfer funds.
</Info>

- Holds usually expire within seven days if the payment isn’t captured.  
- Because no money moves, authorizations cannot be refunded—they simply drop from the statement.

## Captured Payment

After a successful checkout, the authorization is captured and the charge posts to your statement.

- EDBB receives the funds.  
- If a refund is approved, it returns as a separate credit once processed by your bank.

If you see a hold without a matching invoice, wait for the authorization to expire or contact your card issuer for details.  
For questions about completed charges, contact Support via the messenger or by email with the invoice number and we’ll review the transaction.

description: "EDBB invoices are issued in EUR. Card and crypto gateways handle conversion automatically based on their prevailing rates."

## Base Currency

All EDBB products and invoices are denominated in **EUR (€)**.  
If you pay in another currency, the payment provider performs the conversion at its own exchange rate.

## Cards

Your card issuer converts the EUR amount to your billing currency.  
Check your bank’s statement or online banking for the final rate and any fees.

## Cryptocurrency

Using CoinPayments or Coinbase Commerce, you choose the coin or token.  
The gateway locks in the EUR-to-crypto rate at the time you initiate the transaction, then provides a wallet address for payment.

Review the quote presented by the provider before confirming to see the final converted amount.

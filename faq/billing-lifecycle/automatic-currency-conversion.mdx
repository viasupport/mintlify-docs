## EDBB Bills in EUR

<Info>
  All invoices are denominated in euro. When you pay with another currency, the conversion happens automatically through your bank, wallet, or crypto gateway.
</Info>

## Paying with Cards

- Stripe charges your card in EUR.  
- Your bank converts the amount to your billing currency using its daily rate and fees.  
- Check the statement or online banking for the final converted value.

## Paying with Crypto

- CoinPayments/Coinbase Commerce quote the EUR → crypto rate at checkout.  
- The rate is locked for a short window—send the exact amount before the timer expires.  
- If the payment arrives late, the gateway may request a top-up or refund the transfer.

## Tips

- Review the conversion summary shown by the provider before approving the transaction.  
- Some cards add FX surcharges; consider wallets or crypto if you want to avoid bank fees.  
- For large payments, confirm limits with your bank or exchange in advance.

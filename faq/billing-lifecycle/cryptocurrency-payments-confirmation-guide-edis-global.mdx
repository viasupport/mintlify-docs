## Confirmation Basics

Invoices paid via crypto are created in EUR and routed through CoinPayments or Coinbase Commerce.  
Once the payment gateway receives the transaction, it waits for a predefined number of on-chain confirmations before automatically flagging the invoice as paid.

## Typical Thresholds

- **Fast networks** (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche): 1 confirmation  
- **Bitcoin & Litecoin**: 1–2 confirmations  
- **Bitcoin Cash**: 6 confirmations  
- **Tron-based USDT**: up to 19 confirmations  
- **Monero**: ~10 confirmations

Exact requirements may change as gateways adjust for network conditions. The gateway checkout page always shows the live requirement before you send funds.

## How to Track Progress

1. Copy the transaction hash (TXID) from your wallet or the payment page.  
2. Paste it into a blockchain explorer for the relevant network.  
3. Compare the reported confirmation count with the threshold shown during checkout.  
4. Once the target is met, the invoice status updates automatically—no manual ticket needed.

## If the Timer Expires

- Most gateways lock the exchange rate for a limited window.  
- If the payment arrives late or with too few confirmations, the gateway may auto-refund or request a top-up.  
- Include the TXID when contacting EDBB Support so we can investigate with the processor.

Understanding these steps ensures a smooth crypto payment experience for your EDBB services.

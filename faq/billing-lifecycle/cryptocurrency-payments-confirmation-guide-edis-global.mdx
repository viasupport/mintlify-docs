## Confirmation Basics

<Info>
  Crypto invoices are priced in EUR, but the gateway waits for the blockchain to reach a set number of confirmations before releasing the funds to EDBB.
</Info>

## Typical Thresholds

- **Fast networks** (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Avalanche): 1 confirmation  
- **Bitcoin & Litecoin**: 1–2 confirmations  
- **Bitcoin Cash**: 6 confirmations  
- **Tron-based USDT**: up to 19 confirmations  
- **Monero**: ~10 confirmations

Exact requirements may change as gateways adjust for network conditions. The gateway checkout page always shows the live requirement before you send funds.

## Track Your Payment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy the TXID">
    Grab the transaction hash from your wallet or the gateway’s receipt page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use a blockchain explorer">
    Paste the TXID into an explorer for that network and watch the confirmation counter.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Match the requirement">
    Compare the explorer’s confirmation count with the threshold shown during checkout. The invoice closes automatically once it hits the target.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## If the Timer Expires

- Most gateways lock the exchange rate for a limited window.  
- If the payment arrives late or with too few confirmations, the gateway may auto-refund or request a top-up.  
- Include the TXID when contacting EDBB Support via the messenger or by email so we can investigate with the processor.

Understanding these steps ensures a smooth crypto payment experience for your EDBB services.

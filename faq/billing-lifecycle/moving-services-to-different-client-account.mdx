## Why Services Can't Be Moved

<Info>
  Every VPS is linked to the customer account that ordered it—billing history, Support PIN, and access controls all depend on that relationship. Moving a live service to another account would break those records, so EDBB treats migrations as new deployments.

## How to Hand Over a Service

<Steps>
  <Step title="Order under the destination account">
    The recipient should deploy a VPS with the required specs in their own EDBB account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Migrate workloads">
    Transfer data using backups, snapshots, or configuration management tools. Update DNS, firewall rules, and monitoring to point at the new instance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retire the original service">
    Once verification is complete, cancel the old VPS so billing, credentials, and support ownership stay in sync.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Keeping each service tied to the correct account maintains a clean audit trail for payments, support requests, and compliance checks.

## Transfer Policy

KVM VPS services are permanently tied to the client account that created them.  
We cannot reassign the KVM ID or billing record to a different account without breaking backend links and access controls.

## Alternatives

- Provision a new VPS under the destination account.  
- Migrate data and configuration manually.  
- Cancel the original service once the migration is complete.

This approach keeps credentials, billing history, and support ownership aligned with the intended customer.

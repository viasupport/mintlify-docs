## How VAT Applies

<Info>
  EDBB is headquartered in Cyprus. We invoice in EUR and follow EU VAT rules based on your billing address and tax status.
</Info>

### VAT Charged Automatically

- Cyprus residents (business or consumer): **19% VAT**  
- EU consumers outside Cyprus: VAT rate of your member state

### When VAT Is 0%

- EU businesses that enter a valid VAT ID (reverse charge)  
- Customers outside the EU or in VAT-exempt territories

Invoices clearly show the rate applied or the reverse-charge note. Keep your company profile and VAT number up to date in the portal before ordering.

## VAT Basics

EDBB is headquartered in Cyprus and invoices in EUR.  
VAT is applied according to EU distance-selling rules and the buyer’s status.

## Charged at Checkout

- **Cyprus residents (B2C & B2B)**: 19% VAT  
- **EU consumers (outside Cyprus)**: VAT rate of the customer’s member state

## Reverse Charge (0% VAT)

- **EU businesses** supplying a valid VAT ID  
- **Customers outside the EU or in VAT-exempt territories**

Invoices display the applied VAT rate or “reverse charge” note as required.  
Ensure company details and VAT numbers are accurate in the customer portal before placing orders.

## Why It Happens

CoinPayments and Coinbase Commerce lock exchange rates for a limited time (typically 60 minutes).  
If the transaction reaches the blockchain after the window, the gateway marks it as delayed and may not auto-match it to your invoice.

## What to Do

1. Collect the transaction hash (TXID) and, if available, the payment reference or order code shown in the gateway.  
2. Open a support ticket with the invoice number, TXID, and timestamp.  
3. EDBB will coordinate with the processor to assign the funds or arrange a refund if appropriate.

Future tip: send the payment immediately after the checkout page displays the wallet and amount to avoid rate-lock expiration.

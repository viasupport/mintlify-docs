description: "If your crypto payment misses the quoted window, share the transaction details with EDBB so we can reconcile it manually."

## Why It Happens

<Info>
  CoinPayments and Coinbase Commerce lock the FX rate for a short window (usually around 60 minutes). Payments that land on-chain after the timer can’t be auto-matched to your invoice without manual review.

## What to Do

<Steps>
  <Step title="Collect the details">
    Save the transaction hash (TXID) and any order reference the gateway displayed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share with Support">
    Contact us via messenger or email with the invoice number, TXID, timestamp, and amount sent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for processor review">
    We liaise with the gateway to apply the payment or trigger a refund, then confirm the outcome.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Future tip: send the payment immediately after the checkout page displays the wallet and amount to avoid rate-lock expiration.

## Why Add Credit

<Info>
  Account credit is optional. It’s useful if you want renewals to auto-charge from a balance, prefer to pre-fund several invoices, or need coverage while traveling.

## How the Balance Is Used

- Future invoices auto-deduct from credit when the due date arrives.  
- Existing unpaid invoices remain outstanding—you can apply credit manually from the invoice view.  
- Overpayments add to your credit; underpayments require an additional top-up to cover the difference.

## Crypto Payment Tips

- Include network fees so the gateway receives the exact requested amount.  
- Slightly overpay if your wallet rounds down dust amounts.  
- If the payment lands short, the system will prompt for a top-up to close the gap.

## Accidental Top-Up Invoices

Created a pro-forma by mistake? Unpaid Add Funds invoices auto-expire after ~36 hours, so you can simply ignore them.

## How to Top Up Your Account Credit  

Adding funds to your account allows you to pay future invoices automatically or manually apply credit to existing invoices.  

## Steps to Add Funds  
1. **Log in** to the [EDBB portal](https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php?action=addfunds).  
2. Go to the **Billing** section.  
3. Click on **"Add Funds"**.  
4. Enter the amount you want to add.  
5. Choose your preferred **payment method**.  
6. Click **"Add Funds"** and follow the checkout process.  

## How Payments Work  
- **Future invoices** will be paid automatically using your account credit.  
- **Existing invoices** are *not* paid automatically, but you can manually apply credit to them.  
- **Overpayments** are credited to your account balance.  
- **Underpayments** (when the full amount is not received) must be resolved manually and may require an additional payment.  

## Important Notes for Crypto Payments  
- Always **cover transaction (TX) fees** when sending crypto payments.  
- To avoid underpayment issues, it’s better to slightly **overpay** rather than risk being short by a small amount.  
- **Underpayments will require an additional payment** to get the full amount credited.  



## Cancel Top-Up Invoices

If you accidentally create one (or even multiple) top-up pro forma invoice, our system will automatically cancel these documents after approximately 36 hours. You don't need to be concerned about these, we'll take care of them automatically.

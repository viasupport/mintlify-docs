## Step 1 — Cancel the Service

<Info>
  You can cancel a VPS anytime from the <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EDBB Control Panel</a>. If you plan to request a refund, choose <strong>Cancel Immediately</strong> so the service stops within minutes.

Subject: 24-hour refund request – VPS cancellation

Hello EDBB Support,

I cancelled my VPS and would like to request a refund under the 24-hour policy.

VPS IPv4: 203.0.113.42
Invoice #: 123456
Order time: 2025-04-12 09:30 UTC
Support PIN: 1AB23
Payment method: Visa ending 1234

Thank you,
<Your name>
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for confirmation">
    We confirm eligibility, issue a credit note, and refund the original payment method. Crypto refunds follow Travel Rule requirements (network, wallet type, beneficiary identity).
  </Step>
</Steps>

Processing times depend on your bank, wallet, or exchange. Cards post within a few business days; crypto payouts depend on blockchain congestion.

Requests submitted after 24 hours, without the required information, or that fall outside the policy will be declined. In those cases we’re happy to move the payment to account credit for future invoices.

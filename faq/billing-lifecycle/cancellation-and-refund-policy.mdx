## Cancellation

You can cancel a VPS at any time from the customer portal.  
Choose **immediate cancellation** if you intend to request a refund.

## 24-Hour Refund Window

- Valid for one VPS purchase per customer within a rolling 12-month period  
- Request must arrive within 24 hours of the original order time  
- Service must not be part of a special promotion, discount code, traffic add-on, or upgrade  
- Cancellation must be effective immediately (not end-of-term)

## How to Request a Refund

1. Cancel the VPS with immediate effect.  
2. Contact Support with the VPS IP address and Support PIN.  
3. We review eligibility, issue a credit note, and refund to the original payment method.  
4. Crypto refunds require wallet details that satisfy the Travel Rule (network, wallet type, and beneficiary identity).  
5. Processing times depend on the payment provider (e.g., some wallets take several business days to display the refund).

Requests submitted after 24 hours or without the required information will be declined.

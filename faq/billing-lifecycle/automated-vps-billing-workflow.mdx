## Invoice & Reminder Schedule

| Day | Event |
|-----|-------|
| -7  | Invoice issued |
| -6  | Automatic card capture attempt |
| -2  | Reminder email |
| 0   | Due date |
| +1  | Overdue reminder 1 |
| +2  | Overdue reminder 2 |
| +3  | Overdue reminder 3 |
| +7  | Service suspended |
| +14 | Contract terminated (instance powered off, data still on disk) |
| +20 | Data deleted permanently |

## Reactivating a Suspended VPS

Pay the outstanding invoice before day +20.  
Once the processor confirms payment, the VPS powers back on automatically.

## After Data Deletion

If the invoice reached **Cancelled** status and data was purged, the service cannot be restored.  
Order a new VPS and restore from your own backups.

Keep payment methods current and maintain regular backups to avoid downtime or data loss.

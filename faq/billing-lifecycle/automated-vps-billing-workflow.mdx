## How the Billing Cycle Flows

<Info>
  EDBB invoices run on a predictable rhythm: reminders before the due date, multiple nudges if payment fails, and a clear suspension/deletion window if the balance stays overdue.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Invoice Creation (Day -7)">
    Seven days before renewal, the system generates the invoice and emails you the PDF.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto-Capture Attempt (Day -6)">
    Saved cards are charged automatically. Update card details in the portal if the attempt fails.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reminder Countdown (Day -2)">
    A friendly reminder lands in your inbox two days before the due date—ideal for manual reviews or alternate payment methods.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invoice Due (Day 0)">
    The service is still active, but payment is now required. Overdue reminders begin the following day.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Overdue Nudges (Day +1, +2, +3)">
    Daily reminders encourage settlement while the VPS continues running. Pay any time to stop the sequence.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Suspension (Day +7)">
    The VPS is powered off and access is blocked. No data is deleted yet—pay the invoice to restore service automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Termination Phase (Day +14)">
    If unpaid, the subscription is terminated. The VPS remains powered off but disk data is still retained.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Final Deletion (Day +20)">
    Storage is wiped permanently. At this point the service cannot be recovered; you’ll need to order a new VPS and restore from backups.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reactivate Before Day +20

- Settle the outstanding invoice and the VPS will power back on automatically.  
- Need more time? Contact Support via messenger or email before suspension hits—we can advise on options.  
- Always maintain off-site backups so you can recover quickly if deletion occurs.

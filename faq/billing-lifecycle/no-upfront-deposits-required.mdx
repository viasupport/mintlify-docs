## No Deposit Needed

<Info>
  You can order any EDBB VPS without keeping a prepaid balance. Place the order, pay the invoice, and you’re live—no security deposit or minimum credit required.

## How Billing Works

- Each service generates a monthly invoice in EUR.  
- Pay with cards, crypto, or supported wallets on or before the due date.  
- As long as invoices are paid in time, services remain active.

## When Credit Comes in Handy

- Pre-load funds if you manage multiple renewals and prefer one payment.  
- Maintain a balance before vacations or maintenance windows so renewals can post without manual action.  
- Combine with automated emails to keep accounting tidy.

Need to park funds in advance? Follow the <a href="./how-to-add-account-credit">Add Account Credit guide</a>. Otherwise, pay-as-you-go works just fine.

## Order Without Prepayments

EDBB does not require a deposit balance before you buy.  
Choose your plan, proceed to checkout, and pay the invoice using credit card or supported cryptocurrencies.

## Optional Account Top-Ups

- Add funds if you prefer invoices to auto-charge from credit.  
- Useful when you expect multiple small renewals or need coverage while you’re away.  
- Top-ups are optional; monthly billing continues to work without them.

All services remain active as long as invoices are paid by the due date.

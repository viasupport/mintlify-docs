## Why Consolidate?

<Info>
  Aligning renewals onto one date simplifies budgeting and accounting—especially if you manage multiple VPSs or projects.
</Info>

- Fewer invoices to track each month.  
- One payment covers every active service aligned to that cycle.  
- Ideal for finance teams that reconcile expenses on a set day.

## How Consolidation Works

- Support assigns a target billing day (for example, the 1st or 15th).  
- You receive a pro-rated adjustment invoice to sync current services.  
- After payment, renewals occur on the chosen date. New services follow their own cycle unless you request another alignment.

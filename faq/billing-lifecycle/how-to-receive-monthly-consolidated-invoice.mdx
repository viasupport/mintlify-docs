## Overview

If you run multiple VPS instances, EDBB can synchronize their renewal dates and issue a single invoice each month.  
This simplifies accounting and reduces the number of payment transactions.

## How It Works

- Support sets a target billing day (e.g., 1st or 15th of the month).  
- You receive a one-time pro-rated adjustment invoice to align all services.  
- After payment, every active service renews on that consolidated date.

New services added later renew on their own schedule unless you request another alignment.

## How to Request

Open a ticket with Support and specify the preferred billing date.  
We’ll guide you through the alignment invoice and confirm once the monthly consolidation is active.

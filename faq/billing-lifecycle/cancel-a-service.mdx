## How to cancel your VPS

Cacel your EDBB VPS directly in the control panel. Select **Request Cancellation** and the time when your cancellation request should take effect. Options are **immediate** **cancellation** or **expiration** (cancellation by the end of the paid timeframe) - your choice.

## Before You Cancel

<Warning>
  Cancellation is irreversible once the six-day retention window passes. Take fresh backups and confirm the correct VPS by double-checking the Primary IPv4 and plan details in the right-hand summary panel.
</Warning>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Request Cancellation">
    In the right-hand panel, press the red <strong>Request Cancellation</strong>
     button. Select whether the VPS should stop <strong>immediately</strong>
     or <strong>at the end of the billing period</strong>
     .

## Pick the Timing That Fits

| Option                 | When it executes                                    | What changes immediately                       | Data removal                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Cancel on expiry**   | Service keeps running until the current due date    | Renewal invoice for the next term is cancelled | VPS is deleted **6 days after** the due date |
| **Cancel immediately** | Shutdown happens as soon as you confirm the request | The VPS powers off and access stops right away | VPS is deleted **6 days after** the request  |

Once the deletion window passes, snapshots and disk data cannot be recovered.

## After You Cancel

- **Invoices stop** – the upcoming renewal is voided so the service will not bill again.
- **Backups first** – download any data you want to keep before the termination window closes.
- **Traffic and addons end together** – attached IPs or traffic pool top-ups are removed when the VPS is deleted.
- **Need it back?** Message Support (messenger or email) before data removal finishes; reinstatement is only possible while the VPS still exists on the platform.

<Note>
  EDBB plans are billed per monthly subscription term. Charges that have already been paid are non-refundable unless the cancellation occurs within the initial 24-hour cooling-off window for brand-new services.

# End a VPS Subscription

You can cancel any EDBB VPS directly from the portal. The request takes effect immediately or at the end of the current billing cycle—your choice.

---

## Submit the Cancellation in the Portal

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to the portal">
    Open the <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank">EDBB VPS Portal</a> and go to <strong>Services</strong>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the VPS record">
    Click the service you want to cancel to view its management dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Request Cancellation">
    In the sidebar, select <strong>Request Cancellation</strong>. Pick whether the service should stop <strong>immediately</strong> or <strong>at the end of the billing period</strong>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the request">
    Submit the form. The portal sends an email confirmation and updates the service status right away.
  </Step>
</Steps>

If you change your mind before data deletion occurs, open a ticket with support and reference the VPS ID so we can review reinstatement options.

## Pick the Timing That Fits

| Option | When it executes | What changes immediately | Data removal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cancel on expiry** | Service keeps running until the current due date | Renewal invoice for the next term is cancelled | VPS is deleted **6 days after** the due date |
| **Cancel immediately** | Shutdown happens as soon as you confirm the request | The VPS powers off and access stops right away | VPS is deleted **6 days after** the request |

Once the deletion window passes, snapshots and disk data cannot be recovered.

---

## After You Cancel

- **Invoices stop** – the upcoming renewal is voided so the service will not bill again.
- **Backups first** – download any data you want to keep before the termination window closes.
- **Traffic and addons end together** – attached IPs or traffic pool top-ups are removed when the VPS is deleted.
- **Need it back?** Open a support ticket before data removal finishes; reinstatement is only possible while the VPS still exists on the platform.

<Note>
  EDBB plans are billed per monthly subscription term. Charges that have already been paid are non-refundable unless the cancellation occurs within the initial 24-hour cooling-off window for brand-new services.

## Eligibility Checklist

<Info>
  EDBB offers refunds within **24 hours** of ordering a new VPS when all policy conditions are satisfied.
</Info>

- Service was ordered less than 24 hours ago  
- No promo codes, add-on traffic, or upgrades were involved  
- No previous refund issued to the same customer within 12 months  
- The VPS has not been suspended for policy violations

When these checks pass, we’ll refund the original payment method. Outside of this window, payments can be converted to account credit instead of refunded.

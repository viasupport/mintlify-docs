## 🕓 Scheduled Billing Window

Every night, **EDBB performs a scheduled billing window** to process invoices, service renewals, and account updates across all active VPS accounts.\
During this time, billing automation ensures accuracy, prevents conflicts, and maintains data integrity.

---

## ⏰ Timeframe

The billing window occurs **daily between midnight and 05:15 CET (Central European Time)**.

| Process                     | CET Time   | UTC Time   |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Pre-billing procedures      | 00:01 CET  | 23:01 UTC  |
| Credit Manipulation – Start | 03:58 CET  | 02:58 UTC  |
| Billrun – Start             | 04:00 CET  | 03:00 UTC  |
| Billrun – End               | ~05:00 CET | ~04:00 UTC |
| Credit Manipulation – End   | 05:15 CET  | 04:15 UTC  |

⚠️ **Do not place new orders or modify services** between **00:00 CET and 05:15 CET**, as transactions may be delayed or temporarily locked during this period. During this time, **account credit may be applied to scheduled invoices**, which might not be desirable if you have **credit manipulation** enabled on your account.

---

## 💰 Credit Manipulation

These are **special pre-billrun procedures** designed to protect billing integrity and prevent unwanted automatic renewals.

At **Credit Manipulation Start**, the system safely **backs up account credit** and temporarily sets it to zero.\
At **Credit Manipulation End**, after the billrun has finished, the **full account credit is restored** to the client account.

### Important:

By default, **99% of customers have their account credit automatically applied** to renewal invoices.\
However, a **small group of resellers** have opted out of this automatic credit application. For these resellers, account credit is locked during the billing window and restored afterward. If you are interested in this billing behaviour, please get in touch with our support team.

## 🧾 What Happens During the Billing Window

1. **Invoice Generation** – Renewal invoices are created for upcoming services.
2. **Credit Card Charges** – Automatic payment attempts are processed.
3. **Credit Manipulation** – Credits are temporarily locked to ensure billing accuracy (if configured).
4. **Service Suspension** – Non-paid services are automatically suspended
4. **Service Termination** – Terminations are processed 
5. **Finalization** – After 05:15 CET, all billing operations resume as normal.

---

## ⚙️ Service Suspension

Service suspension (if related to non-payments) happens **during the billrun window**.\
If your service is suspended for non-payment, it will automatically reactivate once an invoice gets paid. Once an invoice shows _cancelled_, it can not longer be paid, the service no longer exists.

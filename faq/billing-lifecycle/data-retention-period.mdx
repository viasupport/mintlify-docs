## VPS Data Deletion

When a VPS is cancelled, the associated storage is wiped **six days** after the termination date.  
Back up important data before you submit the cancellation request—restoration is not possible once deletion occurs.

## Downloadable qcow2 Backups

- Fee: **€25** per export  
- Download link expires after **30 days**  
- Links are password-protected and removed automatically once the window closes

Plan your download schedule accordingly so the qcow2 file is archived to your systems before the link expires.

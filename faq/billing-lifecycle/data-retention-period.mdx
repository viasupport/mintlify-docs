## VPS Retention Timeline

<Info>
  Once a VPS is cancelled (immediate or end-of-term), the instance stays in the platform for **six days**. After that, storage is wiped and recovery is impossible.
</Info>

- Use the window to collect final backups or confirm your migration succeeded.  
- Ensure snapshots, ISO mounts, and secondary IPs are no longer needed before the timer expires.

## qcow2 Export Availability

- A downloadable `.qcow2` image costs **€25** per export.  
- Download links remain active for **30 days** and are password-protected.  
- Links are deleted automatically after the window closes for security.

Plan your archival workflow so exports are downloaded to your storage before the link expires.

## Relocation Policy

Each EDBB VPS is bound to a specific data center and IP allocation.  
We cannot migrate the same instance to another city or country because routing, storage, and compliance differ per location.

## How to Switch Regions

1. Order a new VPS in the desired facility via the EDBB portal.  
2. Migrate data and services to the new instance.  
3. Cancel the original VPS once the move is completed.

Choose the target site carefully to align with latency, compliance, or GeoIP requirements going forward.

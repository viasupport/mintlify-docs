## Why We Don’t “Move” an Existing VPS

<Info>
  Every EDBB VPS is tied to the hardware, storage, and IP blocks of a specific data center. Relocating it mid-life would break routing policy, compliance obligations, and physical storage assignments—so we treat a new location as a fresh deployment.

## How to Change Regions the Right Way

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deploy in the new location">
    Order a VPS in the target facility from the <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EDBB VPS Portal</a>. Match the plan size so migrations stay simple.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Migrate data and services">
    Use snapshots, rsync, database dumps, or configuration management to move workloads from the original instance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retire the old VPS">
    After validation, cancel the previous VPS to stop billing. Remember to update DNS, allow-lists, and monitoring endpoints with the new IP.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips Before You Provision

- Confirm latency with the <a href="https://latency.edbb.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">EDBB latency dashboard</a> or Looking Glass.  
- Check regional compliance requirements (data residency, licensing) ahead of time.  
- Plan for GeoIP propagation—most databases refresh within a few days of the new IP going live.

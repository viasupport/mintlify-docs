<Info>
  The traffic pool is like a bank account holding a traffic reserve. Top-up your account and assign traffic to any VPS in your account when needed.
</Info>

- Unused Pool Traffic does not expire.
- Hydration assigns traffic to a VPS (manual or auto at 99% usage)
- Traffic purchases are instant and are logged in the pool log.
- Traffic assignments are instant and are logged in the hydration log

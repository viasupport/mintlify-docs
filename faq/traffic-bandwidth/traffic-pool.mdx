## What Is a Traffic Pool?

<Info>
  The traffic pool is like a bank account holding a traffic reserve. Top-up your account and assign traffic to any VPS in your account when needed.
</Info>

- Pool traffic never expires.
- Assignments take effect instantly and appear in the hydration log.
- Auto hydration refills a VPS the moment it reaches 99% usage.

**A — Traffic Pool Balance**: shows remaining TB and provides a button to <strong>Top up</strong>
 the pool.\
**B — Manual Hydration**: manually assign portions of +100 GB, +500 GB, +1 TB, or +10 TB to the selected VPS.\
**C — Auto Hydration**: choose a profile (e.g., +100 GB). The system automatically adds e.g. +100GB to your VPS at 99% traffic usage levels.

## Monitor, Refill, and Stay Ahead

- Check pool balance and assignment history via the **Hydration log** and **Pool log** buttons.
- Email alerts fire at 80%, 90%, and 100% pool usage; top up before the balance is exhausted.
- Combine pool top-ups with plan upgrades if your baseline traffic requirement grows over time.

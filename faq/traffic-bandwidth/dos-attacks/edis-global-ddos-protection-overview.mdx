## Protection Scope

EDBB runs upstream filtering and mitigation to protect core infrastructure and neighboring customers.  
This keeps the network stable when a tenant is targeted.

## Limitations

- We do not provide dedicated, per-service scrubbing.  
- If an attack jeopardizes platform stability, the affected IP may be null routed until the volume subsides.  
- High-risk workloads should deploy specialized mitigation (e.g., reverse proxies, third-party scrubbing) in front of the VPS.

Refer to the advisory for high-risk clients for additional guidance on running services that attract frequent DDoS activity.

## Assess Your Risk Profile

If your application is routinely targeted by DDoS attacks, consider whether a standard VPS platform meets your needs.  
EDBB safeguards shared infrastructure, but we do not deliver per-customer scrubbing or bespoke mitigation.

## Recommended Approach

- Use providers that specialize in absorbing sustained attacks (e.g., CDN/scrubbing services).  
- Place EDBB instances behind reverse proxies or filtering stacks when possible.  
- Maintain incident response plans and upstream contacts for rapid mitigation.

Choosing the right architecture helps protect your project and ensures the EDBB network stays stable for all customers.

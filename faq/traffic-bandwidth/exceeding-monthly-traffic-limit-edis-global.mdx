## Throttle Behavior

After your plan’s traffic allowance is fully consumed (with a 5% grace), the NIC is limited to approximately 64 kbit/s.  
The VPS remains online but responses will be slow.

## Restore Full Speed

- **Upgrade the plan** for a higher monthly allowance.  
- **Assign pool traffic** manually or via auto hydration if you maintain a pool balance.  
- **Wait for the next reset** on the service renewal date.

Applying additional traffic or upgrading removes the throttle immediately.

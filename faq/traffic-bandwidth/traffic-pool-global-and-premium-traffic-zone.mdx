## Traffic Pool Basics

Buy traffic once and allocate it to any VPS in your account.  
Manual hydration buttons add 100 GB, 500 GB, 1 TB, or 10 TB at a time.  
Auto hydration can top up selected servers automatically when usage hits 99%.

Traffic never expires; it remains in the pool until assigned.

## Zones & Multipliers

- **Global zone**: 1 TB assigned = 1 TB consumed  
- **Premium zone** (e.g., Cyprus, UAE, Australia, Chile, Colombia): 1 TB assigned = 0.5 TB consumed

Choose the traffic amount based on where your VPSs operate.

## Notifications & Monitoring

The portal shows pool balance, assignments, and history.  
Email alerts trigger when 80% of the pool balance has been used so you can top up before running out.

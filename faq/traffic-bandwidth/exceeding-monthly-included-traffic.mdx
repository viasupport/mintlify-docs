## What Happens When You Hit the Limit

<Info>
  Once your monthly traffic allowance (plus a 5% grace buffer) is exhausted, EDBB throttles the VPS NIC to roughly **64 kbit/s**. The VM stays online, but production workloads will feel sluggish until you add traffic or reach the next reset.

## Options to Restore Full Speed

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="🔁 Assign Pool Traffic">
    Move capacity from your global traffic pool. Manual assignments apply instantly; auto hydration can top up automatically if enabled.
  </Card>
  <Card title="📦 Upgrade Your Plan">
    Switching to a plan with a larger monthly allowance removes the throttle as soon as the upgrade completes.

  <Card title="🕒 Wait for Renewal">
    If you don’t need immediate bandwidth, the cap lifts automatically on the next billing cycle reset.

## Stay Ahead of the Curve

- Monitor usage on the **Traffic** tab in the Control Panel—graphs show both consumption and remaining pool balance.  
- Set calendar reminders around high-usage campaigns so you can assign extra traffic proactively.  
- Combine with off-peak batch jobs or CDN caching to stretch your allowance further.

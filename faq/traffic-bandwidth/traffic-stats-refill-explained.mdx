<Info>
  In the <a href="https://my.edbb.com/clientarea.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  EDBB Control Panel</a>

  , open your VPS and switch to the <strong>Traffic</strong>

## Read the Summary Card

- **Progress ring** – % of your monthly allowance consumed.
- **Numerical usage** – exact GB used vs. available.
- **Refill timer** – when the allowance resets (matches your VPS renewal date).

![Cumulative traffic chart](/assets/cumulative_traffic.png)

Email alerts land at 80%, 90%, and 100%, but the Control Panel indicator is the quickest way to spot high usage.

## Inspect Daily - Cumulative Graphs

- Hover over the bars to see each day’s combined ingress + egress in GB.
- Use the cumulative chart to verify long-running jobs or unexpected spikes.

## Manage Traffic Pool - Hydration

![Manual and auto hydration tabs](/assets/traffic-pool-edbb-manual-auto-hydration.png)

**A — Traffic Pool**\
Shows the shared balance for your account. Click “Top up” to purchase more capacity when needed.

**B — Manual Hydration**\
Select a block (+100 GB, +500 GB, +1 TB, +10 TB) and press **Assign Traffic** to add it instantly to the VPS.

**C — Auto Hydration**\
Set a top-up size (e.g., +100 GB). When usage hits 99%, the chosen amount is assigned automatically. Check the status banner for the active rule.

All assignments are logged under **Hydration log** and **Pool log**.

## What Happens at 100% Usage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Grace & throttle">
    After a 5% grace buffer, the NIC is capped at roughly <strong>64 kbit/s</strong>
    . The VPS stays online but feels slow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restore full speed">
    Assign pool traffic, upgrade the plan, or wait for the monthly refill—any of these actions lifts the throttle immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stay proactive">
    Monitor the Traffic tab and enable auto hydration if you run resource-heavy workloads. Always keep recent off-site backups in case you choose to wait for the reset window.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### How We Meter Traffic

EDBB reads traffic counters directly on the Ethernet interfaces of your Virtual Private Servers in real-time. The total traffic usage is determined by summing up the ingress (incoming) and egress (outgoing) traffic.

$Total Traffic  =  \sum (\text{IN} + \text{OUT})$

## Where to Check Usage

1. Log in to the EDBB client portal.  
2. Select your VPS under **Services**.  
3. Review the **Traffic Information** widget for:  
   - Total traffic consumed this cycle  
   - Remaining allocation  
   - Days until the next monthly refill

Daily charts provide an overview of inbound + outbound usage. Totals reset on the VPS renewal date.

## Metering & Alerts

Traffic is counted as the sum of ingress and egress on the virtual NIC.  
Email warnings trigger at 80%, 90%, and 100% of the plan limit.

## At 100% Usage

The interface throttles to roughly 64 kbit/s after a small 5% grace buffer.  
There are no overage fees; service remains online at the reduced speed.

To regain full throughput, either wait for the monthly refill or add capacity via the traffic pool or a plan upgrade.

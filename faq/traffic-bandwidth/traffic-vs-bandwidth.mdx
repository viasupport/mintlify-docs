## Same Pipe, Different Metrics

<Info>
  Bandwidth is the **speed limit** of your port; traffic is the **amount of data** you actually move during a billing cycle.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="🚀 Bandwidth">
    <ul>
      <li>Measured in Mbit/s or Gbit/s</li>
      <li>Represents real-time throughput capacity</li>
      <li>EDBB hypervisors use multi-gigabit uplinks for bursty workloads</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="📦 Traffic">
    <ul>
      <li>Measured in GB or TB per month</li>
      <li>Counts all in/out data transfer during the billing period</li>
      <li>Each VPS plan includes a traffic pool you can top up if needed</li>
    </ul>

## Visualizing the Difference

Imagine a highway:

- **Bandwidth** is how many lanes you have—the maximum cars per second.  
- **Traffic** is how many cars actually drove down that highway this month.  
- You can burst to the full lane capacity, but the total number of cars still counts toward your traffic allowance.

Track both metrics in the EDBB portal under the **Traffic** tab; it shows current throughput and period-to-date usage side by side.

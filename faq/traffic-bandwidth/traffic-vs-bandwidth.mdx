## Bandwidth

Represents the capacity of the network port.  
EDBB host nodes provide multi-gigabit uplinks so bursts of traffic can flow without congestion.

## Traffic

Totals the amount of data sent and received during a billing period.  
Your VPS plan includes a monthly traffic allowance measured in GB or TB.

Think of bandwidth as the width of a pipe and traffic as the volume of water that passed through it over time.

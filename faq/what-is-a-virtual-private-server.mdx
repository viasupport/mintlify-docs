## VPS Fundamentals

An EDBB **Virtual Private Server (VPS)** is a virtual machine with dedicated CPU, RAM, and storage carved from enterprise hardware.  
Unlike shared hosting, you receive isolated resources and full root access, so your applications run independently of other customers.

With a VPS you can install any operating system image we provide, customize services, and scale resources as your project grows.

## Typical Workloads

- **Web platforms** – host WordPress, headless CMS, or multi-tenant SaaS stacks.  
- **Databases** – run MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, or MongoDB with predictable performance.  
- **Application backends** – deploy APIs, microservices, or message brokers.  
- **Game servers** – power Minecraft, Valheim, or CS:GO with low-latency networks.  
- **Security tooling** – build VPN endpoints, intrusion detection, or honeypots.  
- **Automation environments** – schedule jobs, run CI pipelines, or orchestrate infrastructure-as-code.  
- **Learning labs** – practice Linux administration, networking, or certification scenarios in an isolated sandbox.

## Why Choose VPS over Shared Hosting?

| Capability | Shared Hosting | EDBB VPS |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| Root access | No | Yes |
| Custom OS | No | Yes |
| Dedicated resources | No | Yes |
| Custom networking | Minimal | Full control (IPv4/IPv6, VLAN options) |
| Performance isolation | Limited | Guaranteed |

- **Performance** – CPU and RAM are reserved for your instance.  
- **Control** – install packages, tweak kernel parameters, or run container runtimes.  
- **Reliability** – live dashboards, rescue ISO access, and direct console support via EDBB portal.  
- **Scalability** – upgrade cores, memory, or storage without rebuilding from scratch.

## Getting Started

1. Pick a location from EDBB’s global footprint.  
2. Choose a plan that matches your CPU, RAM, and storage needs.  
3. Add optional Cloud-Init scripts for automated setup.  
4. Deploy instantly and connect via SSH or RDP (for Windows images).

A VPS balances flexibility and cost, giving you near-dedicated performance without physical server complexity.

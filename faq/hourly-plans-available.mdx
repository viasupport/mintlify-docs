# Monthly Billing Instead of Hourly

<Info>
  EDBB uses monthly billing for all VPS plans. The entry plan starts at €4.99/month—roughly €0.0068 per hour—so you get near-hourly economics without micro-transactions.

## Why We Skip Hourly Invoicing

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="💳 Gateway Fees">
    Payment processors charge fixed fees that exceed the value of tiny hourly invoices.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🧾 Operational Overhead">
    Hourly suspensions, reinstatements, and accounting add complexity without benefiting most customers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="📘 Predictable Costs">
    Monthly billing keeps budgeting simple while still delivering a low effective hourly rate.
  </Card>
  <Card title="⚙️ Same Feature Set">
    You still get Cloud-Init, API hooks, and instant deployment—only billing differs.

## Working Within Monthly Billing

- Order the smallest plan, use it for as long as needed, then cancel before the next renewal.  
- Take advantage of the 24-hour refund window to evaluate the platform risk-free.  
- Use automation (Cloud-Init, Ansible, Terraform) to spin environments up and down quickly even though billing is monthly.  
- Track costs per project by tagging VPSs and exporting invoices from the portal.

Monthly pricing still unlocks EDBB’s global network, rescue tools, and support—without watching the clock.

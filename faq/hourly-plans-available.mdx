## Monthly Plans Instead of Hourly

EDBB does not provide per-hour billing.  
Our entry KVM VPS plans start at **€4.99 per month**, which equates to roughly €0.0068 per hour—comparable to pay-as-you-go rates without micro-transactions.

## Why We Skip Hourly Billing

- **Processor fees** – payment gateways charge fixed fees that exceed the value of small, hourly invoices.  
- **Operational overhead** – hourly accounting, suspensions, and reinstatements add complexity without benefiting most customers.  
- **Transparent pricing** – monthly billing keeps budgets predictable while still offering a low effective hourly cost.

## Working Within Monthly Billing

- Order the smallest plan, use it for the duration you need, then cancel before the next renewal.  
- Take advantage of the 24-hour refund option to evaluate the platform risk-free.  
- Use Cloud-Init or automation scripts to spin environments up and down quickly even though billing is monthly.

With monthly billing, you still gain access to EDBB’s global network, rescue tools, and support without watching the clock.

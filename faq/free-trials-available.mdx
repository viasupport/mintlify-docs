## No Free Trials, But a Fast Refund Option

EDBB does not provide complimentary VPS trials.  
Provisioning infrastructure, software licenses, and payment processing costs make true “free tiers” impractical.

Instead, every VPS order is backed by a **24-hour refund window**. Spin up any plan, test to your satisfaction, and cancel within the first day for a full refund if it isn’t the right fit.

## How to Evaluate Before You Buy

1. **Latency Check** – run tests with the [EDBB latency tool](https://latency.edbb.com) to identify the best location.  
2. **Looking Glass** – inspect routing paths from multiple regions via our [Looking Glass endpoints](https://www.edbb.com/blog/looking-glass#list-of-our-worldwide-looking-glass-servers).  
3. **Pingable Gateways** – benchmark round-trip times using the [public gateway list](https://my.edbb.com/stgfefew_net_list.php).  
4. **Network Map** – explore data center locations on [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1OMZyb6w3t_MNEQ-XYb8QlFjwqio&usp=sharing).

These tools let you validate network performance without provisioning a server.

## Frequently Asked

**Why no free credits?**  
KVM virtualization and global PoPs incur real costs even during evaluation. The refund approach keeps pricing fair for all customers.

**Can I cancel after a few days?**  
You can cancel whenever you like, but refunds are only guaranteed within 24 hours of initial provisioning.

**What if I need long-term testing?**  
Order the smallest plan, automate installation with Cloud-Init, and cancel once testing is complete. Monthly pricing remains only a few euros.

# Evaluation Options Without a Free Trial

<Info>
  EDBB does not run complimentary VPS trials. Instead, every new order includes a 24-hour refund window—spin up a plan, test it thoroughly, and cancel within the first day for a full refund if it’s not a fit.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why no free credits?**  
KVM virtualization, software licensing, and payment processing costs make true “free tiers” unsustainable. The refund window keeps pricing fair for everyone.

**Can I cancel after a few days?**  
You can cancel anytime, but refunds are only guaranteed within the first 24 hours of provisioning.

**Need long-term evaluation?**  
Order the smallest plan, automate setup with Cloud-Init, and cancel once testing is complete. The monthly cost is only a few euros, comparable to hourly providers.

With these tools and the 24-hour refund policy, you can evaluate EDBB confidently without an ongoing free trial program.

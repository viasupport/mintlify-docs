# 🚀 Kick Off Your VPS

Welcome to **EDBB VPS hosting**!  
This playbook walks you through the essential first moves so you can connect, secure, and update your server without guesswork.

---

## 1. Locate the Welcome Email

Once the order is paid, a **Welcome Email** arrives with everything you need:

- Primary **IPv4 address**
- Default **user credentials**
- Provisioned **operating system**
- A direct link to the **management dashboard**

Don’t see the message? Inspect your **Spam** or **Junk** folders, then reach out via the blue chat icon if you still can’t find it.

---

## 2. Sign in to the Control Panel

The **Management Dashboard** keeps all VPS controls in one place:

<CtaButton label="Open the EDBB VPS Portal" link="https://my.edbb.com" />

Inside the portal you can:
- Power cycle or reboot your VPS
- Trigger operating system reinstalls
- Review network assignments and IP pools
- Launch the integrated VNC console
- Monitor traffic usage
- Order additional resources (IPs, RAM, CPU)

> 💡 **Tip:** Always log out of the dashboard on shared devices and rotate your panel password periodically.

---

## 3. Establish Remote Access

Choose the walkthrough that matches your operating system and follow the click-by-click instructions there.

<div style={{display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "12px"}}>
  <CtaButton label="🐧 Linux SSH Guide" link="/linux-secure-shell-ssh" />
  <CtaButton label="🪟 Windows RDP Guide" link="/windows-remote-desktop" />
</div>

---

## 4. Rotate the Default Passwords

Protect the server by replacing default credentials immediately after the first login.

### Linux VPS

Run the `passwd` utility:

```bash
passwd
```

Provide the current password followed by a strong new passphrase (at least 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols).

### Windows VPS

1. Press **Ctrl + Alt + End** (or use the on-screen keyboard on macOS).
2. Choose **Change a password**.
3. Submit the old password, then enter and confirm the new one.
4. Press **Enter**.

Store new credentials in a secure password manager.

---

## 5. Apply System Updates (Linux Only)

If you’re running a Linux VPS, pull the latest security patches before installing additional software.

**Debian / Ubuntu**

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

**AlmaLinux / Rocky / CentOS**

```bash
dnf update -y
```

Staying current keeps your platform secure and stable.

---

## 6. Configure Hostname and Reverse DNS (Optional)

Assign a descriptive hostname:

```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname myserver.example.com
```

For PTR (reverse DNS) management, use the **rDNS** section in the dashboard. Matching hostnames with PTR records improves email reputation and log clarity.

---
